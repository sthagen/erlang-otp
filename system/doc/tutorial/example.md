# Problem Example

## Description

A common interoperability situation is when you want to incorporate a piece of
code, solving a complex problem, in your Erlang program. Suppose for example,
that you have the following C functions that you would like to call from Erlang:

```text

/* complex.c */

int foo(int x) {
  return x+1;
}

int bar(int y) {
  return y*2;
}
```

The functions are deliberately kept as simple as possible, for readability
reasons.

From an Erlang perspective, it is preferable to be able to call `foo` and `bar`
without having to bother about that they are C functions:

```erlang
% Erlang code
...
Res = complex:foo(X),
...
```

Here, the communication with C is hidden in the implementation of `complex.erl`.
In the following sections, it is shown how this module can be implemented using
the different interoperability mechanisms.
