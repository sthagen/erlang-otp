### Vanilla Driver

The obsolete and undocumented support for opening a port to an external
resource by passing an atom (or a string) as first argument to
[`open_port()`](`erlang:open_port/2`), implemented by the vanilla driver,
has been removed. This feature has been scheduled for removal in OTP 27
since the release of OTP 26.
