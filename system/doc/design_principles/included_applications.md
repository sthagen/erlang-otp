# Included Applications

[](){: #included-appl }

## Introduction

An application can _include_ other applications. An _included application_ has
its own application directory and `.app` file, but it is started as part of the
supervisor tree of another application.

An application can only be included by one other application.

An included application can include other applications.

An application that is not included by any other application is called a
_primary application_.

![Primary Application and Included Applications](assets/inclappls.gif "Primary Application and Included Applications")

The application controller automatically loads any included applications when
loading a primary application, but does not start them. Instead, the top
supervisor of the included application must be started by a supervisor in the
including application.

This means that when running, an included application is in fact part of the
primary application, and a process in an included application considers itself
belonging to the primary application.

## Specifying Included Applications

Which applications to include is defined by the `included_applications` key in
the `.app` file:

```erlang
{application, prim_app,
 [{description, "Tree application"},
  {vsn, "1"},
  {modules, [prim_app_cb, prim_app_sup, prim_app_server]},
  {registered, [prim_app_server]},
  {included_applications, [incl_app]},
  {applications, [kernel, stdlib, sasl]},
  {mod, {prim_app_cb,[]}},
  {env, [{file, "/usr/local/log"}]}
 ]}.
```

## Synchronizing Processes during Startup

The supervisor tree of an included application is started as part of the
supervisor tree of the including application. If there is a need for
synchronization between processes in the including and included applications,
this can be achieved by using _start phases_.

Start phases are defined by the `start_phases` key in the `.app` file as a list
of tuples `{Phase,PhaseArgs}`, where `Phase` is an atom and `PhaseArgs` is a
term.

The value of the `mod` key of the including application must be set to
`{application_starter,[Module,StartArgs]}`, where `Module` as usual is the
application callback module. `StartArgs` is a term provided as argument to the
callback function `Module:start/2`:

```erlang
{application, prim_app,
 [{description, "Tree application"},
  {vsn, "1"},
  {modules, [prim_app_cb, prim_app_sup, prim_app_server]},
  {registered, [prim_app_server]},
  {included_applications, [incl_app]},
  {start_phases, [{init,[]}, {go,[]}]},
  {applications, [kernel, stdlib, sasl]},
  {mod, {application_starter,[prim_app_cb,[]]}},
  {env, [{file, "/usr/local/log"}]}
 ]}.

{application, incl_app,
 [{description, "Included application"},
  {vsn, "1"},
  {modules, [incl_app_cb, incl_app_sup, incl_app_server]},
  {registered, []},
  {start_phases, [{go,[]}]},
  {applications, [kernel, stdlib, sasl]},
  {mod, {incl_app_cb,[]}}
 ]}.
```

When starting a primary application with included applications, the primary
application is started the normal way, that is:

- The application controller creates an application master for the application
- The application master calls `Module:start(normal, StartArgs)` to start the
  top supervisor.

Then, for the primary application and each included application in top-down,
left-to-right order, the application master calls
`Module:start_phase(Phase, Type, PhaseArgs)` for each phase defined for the
primary application, in that order. If a phase is not defined for an included
application, the function is not called for this phase and application.

The following requirements apply to the `.app` file for an included application:

- The `{mod, {Module,StartArgs}}` option must be included. This option is used
  to find the callback module `Module` of the application. `StartArgs` is
  ignored, as `Module:start/2` is called only for the primary application.
- If the included application itself contains included applications, instead the
  `{mod, {application_starter, [Module,StartArgs]}}` option must be included.
- The `{start_phases, [{Phase,PhaseArgs}]}` option must be included, and the set
  of specified phases must be a subset of the set of phases specified for the
  primary application.

When starting `prim_app` as defined above, the application controller calls the
following callback functions before `application:start(prim_app)` returns a
value:

```erlang
application:start(prim_app)
 => prim_app_cb:start(normal, [])
 => prim_app_cb:start_phase(init, normal, [])
 => prim_app_cb:start_phase(go, normal, [])
 => incl_app_cb:start_phase(go, normal, [])
ok
```
