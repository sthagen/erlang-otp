# Windows NT

[](){: #windows-nt }

This section describes the operating system-specific parts of OTP that relate to
Windows NT.

A normal installation of Windows NT 4.0, with Service Pack 4 or later, is
required for an embedded Windows NT running OTP.

## Memory Use

RAM memory of 96 MB is recommended to run OTP on Windows NT. A system with less
than 64 MB of RAM is not recommended.

## Disk Space Use

A minimum Windows NT installation with networking needs 250 MB, and an extra 130
MB for the swap file.

## Installing an Embedded System

Normal Windows NT installation is performed. No additional application programs
are needed, such as Internet Explorer or web server. Networking with TCP/IP is
required.

Service Pack 4 or later must be installed.

### Hardware Watchdog

For Windows NT running on standard PCs with ISA and/or PCI bus, an extension
card with a hardware watchdog can be installed.

For more information, see the `m:heart` manual page in Kernel.

## Starting Erlang

On an embedded system, the `erlsrv` module is to be used to install the Erlang
process as a Windows system service. This service can start after Windows NT has
booted.

For more information, see the `erlsrv` manual page in ERTS.
