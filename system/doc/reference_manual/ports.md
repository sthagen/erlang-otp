# Ports and Port Drivers

Examples of how to use ports and port drivers are provided in
[Interoperability Tutorial](`e:system:tutorial.md`).
For information about the BIFs mentioned, see the `m:erlang` manual page in
ERTS.

## Ports

_Ports_ provide the basic mechanism for communication with the external world,
from Erlang's point of view. They provide a byte-oriented interface to an
external program. When a port has been created, Erlang can communicate with it
by sending and receiving lists of bytes, including binaries.

The Erlang process creating a port is said to be the _port owner_, or the
_connected process_ of the port. All communication to and from the port must go
through the port owner. If the port owner terminates, so does the port (and the
external program, if it is written correctly).

The external program resides in another OS process. By default, it reads from
standard input (file descriptor 0) and writes to standard output (file
descriptor 1). The external program is to terminate when the port is closed.

## Port Drivers

It is possible to write a driver in C according to certain principles and
dynamically link it to the Erlang runtime system. The linked-in driver looks
like a port from the Erlang programmer's point of view and is called a _port
driver_.

> #### Warning {: .warning }
>
> An erroneous port driver causes the entire Erlang runtime system to leak
> memory, hang or crash.

For information about port drivers, see the
[erl_driver(4)](`e:erts:erl_driver.md`) manual page in ERTS,
[driver_entry(1)](`e:erts:driver_entry.md`) manual page in ERTS, and
`m:erl_ddll` manual page in Kernel.

## Port BIFs

To create a port:

| `open_port(PortName, PortSettings` | Returns a port identifier `Port` as the result of opening a new Erlang port. Messages can be sent to, and received from, a port identifier, just like a pid. Port identifiers can also be linked to using [`link/1`](`link/1`), or registered under a name using [`register/2`](`register/2`). |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

_Table: Port Creation BIF_

`PortName` is usually a tuple `{spawn,Command}`, where the string `Command` is
the name of the external program. The external program runs outside the Erlang
workspace, unless a port driver with the name `Command` is found. If `Command`
is found, that driver is started.

`PortSettings` is a list of settings (options) for the port. The list typically
contains at least a tuple `{packet,N}`, which specifies that data sent between
the port and the external program are preceded by an N-byte length indicator.
Valid values for N are 1, 2, or 4. If binaries are to be used instead of lists
of bytes, the option `binary` must be included.

The port owner `Pid` can communicate with the port `Port` by sending and
receiving messages. (In fact, any process can send the messages to the port, but
the port owner must be identified in the message).

Messages sent to ports are delivered asynchronously.

> #### Change {: .info }
>
> Before Erlang/OTP 16, messages to ports were delivered synchronously.

In the following tables of examples, `Data` must be an I/O list. An I/O list is
a binary or a (possibly deep) list of binaries or integers in the range 0..255:

| _Message_                | _Description_                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{Pid,{command,Data}}`   | Sends `Data` to the port.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `{Pid,close}`            | Closes the port. Unless the port is already closed, the port replies with `{Port,closed}` when all buffers have been flushed and the port really closes.                                                                              |
| `{Pid,{connect,NewPid}}` | Sets the port owner of `Port` to `NewPid`. Unless the port is already closed, the port replies with`{Port,connected}` to the old port owner. Note that the old port owner is still linked to the port, but the new port owner is not. |

_Table: Messages Sent To a Port_

| _Message_              | _Description_                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `{Port,{data,Data}}`   | `Data` is received from the external program. |
| `{Port,closed}`        | Reply to `Port ! {Pid,close}`.                |
| `{Port,connected}`     | Reply to `Port ! {Pid,{connect,NewPid}}`.     |
| `{'EXIT',Port,Reason}` | If the port has terminated for some reason.   |

_Table: Messages Received From a Port_

Instead of sending and receiving messages, there are also a number of BIFs that
can be used:

| _Port BIF_                                      | _Description_                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`port_command(Port,Data)`](`port_command/2`)   | Sends `Data` to the port.                                                                                                                                      |
| [`port_close(Port)`](`port_close/1`)            | Closes the port.                                                                                                                                               |
| [`port_connect(Port,NewPid)`](`port_connect/2`) | Sets the port owner of `Port`to `NewPid`. The old port owner `Pid` stays linked to the port and must call [`unlink(Port)`](`unlink/1`) if this is not desired. |
| `erlang:port_info(Port,Item)`                   | Returns information as specified by `Item`.                                                                                                                    |
| `erlang:ports()`                                | Returns a list of all ports on the current node.                                                                                                               |

_Table: Port BIFs_

Some additional BIFs that apply to port drivers:
[`port_control/3`](`port_control/3`) and `erlang:port_call/3`.
