  Describes how to build and install Erlang/OTP on Unix and Windows.
* [Getting Started With Erlang](getting_started/getting_started.md) -
  Describes how to get up and running with programming Erlang.
* [System Principles](system_principles/system_principles.md) -
  Describes how to build Erlang/OTP systems.
* [OTP Design Principles](design_principles/design_principles.md) -
  Describes how to build Erlang/OTP applications.
* [Programming Examples](programming_examples/programming_examples.md) -
  Examples on using records, funs, list comprehensions, and the bit syntax.
* [Erlang Reference Manual](reference_manual/reference_manual.md) -
  This section is the Erlang reference manual. It describes the Erlang programming language.
