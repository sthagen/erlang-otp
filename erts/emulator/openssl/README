This directory contains a *very* small part of OpenSSL. Currently only parts
of the OpenSSL MD5 implementation.

The files that has been taken from the 3.1.4 version of OpenSSL:

./LICENSE.txt
./crypto/md5/md5_local.h
./crypto/md5/md5_dgst.c
./include/crypto/md32_common.h
./include/openssl_local/md5.h (renamed from include/openssl/md5.h)

The openssl.diff file contains the diff between the original files and the ones
included in OTP.

Ignoring LICENSE.txt (which contains the full Apache 2.0 license) the
copyright and license notice of the above OpenSSL files are as follows
(copyright years differ a bit):
