# tty - A Command-Line Interface

`tty` is a simple command-line interface program where keystrokes are collected
and interpreted. Completed lines are sent to the shell for interpretation. A
simple history mechanism saves previous lines, which can be edited before
sending them to the shell. `tty` is started when Erlang is started with the
following command:

```text
erl
```

`tty` operates in several different modes:

- Normal mode, in which text lines can be edited and sent to the shell.
- Search mode, in which the user can search for previous commands in the history
  buffer.
- Shell break mode, which allows the user to kill the current shell, start
  multiple shells, and so on.

## Normal Mode

In normal mode keystrokes from the user are collected and interpreted by `tty`.
Most of the _Emacs_ line-editing commands are supported. The following is a
complete list of the supported line-editing commands.

Typographic conventions:

- `C-a` means pressing the _Ctrl_ key and the letter `a` simultaneously.
- `C-S-a` means pressing the _Ctrl_ key, the _Shift_ key, and the letter `a`
  simultaneously.
- `M-f` means pressing the _Esc_ key and the letter `f` in sequence or pressing
  the _Alt_ key and the letter `f` simultaneously.
- `Home` and `End` represent the keys with the same name on the keyboard.
- `Left`, `Right`, `Up` and `Down` represent the corresponding arrow keys.
- When a function has multiple possible key sequences they are listed on
  individual lines in the `Key Sequence` column.
