# erts_alloc

An Erlang runtime system internal memory allocator library.

## Description

`erts_alloc` is an Erlang runtime system internal memory allocator library.
`erts_alloc` provides the Erlang runtime system with a number of memory
allocators.

## Allocators

The following allocators are present:

- **`temp_alloc`** - Allocator used for temporary allocations.

- **`eheap_alloc`** - Allocator used for Erlang heap data, such as Erlang
  process heaps.

- **`binary_alloc`** - Allocator used for Erlang binary data.

- **`ets_alloc`** - Allocator used for `ets` data.

- **`driver_alloc`** - Allocator used for driver data.

- **`literal_alloc`** - Allocator used for constant terms in Erlang code.

- **`sl_alloc`** - Allocator used for memory blocks that are expected to be
  short-lived.

- **`ll_alloc`** - Allocator used for memory blocks that are expected to be
  long-lived, for example, Erlang code.

- **`fix_alloc`** - A fast allocator used for some frequently used fixed size
  data types.

- **`std_alloc`** - Allocator used for most memory blocks not allocated through
  any of the other allocators described above.

- **`sys_alloc`** - This is normally the default `malloc` implementation used on
  the specific OS.

- **`mseg_alloc`** - A memory segment allocator. It is used by other allocators
  for allocating memory segments and is only available on systems that have the
  `mmap` system call. Memory segments that are deallocated are kept for a while
  in a segment cache before they are destroyed. When segments are allocated,
  cached segments are used if possible instead of creating new segments. This to
  reduce the number of system calls made.

`sys_alloc`, `literal_alloc` and `temp_alloc` are always enabled and cannot be
disabled. `mseg_alloc` is always enabled if it is available and an allocator
that uses it is enabled. All other allocators can be
[enabled or disabled](erts_alloc.md#M_e). By default all allocators are enabled.
When an allocator is disabled, `sys_alloc` is used instead of the disabled
allocator.

The main idea with the `erts_alloc` library is to separate memory blocks that
are used differently into different memory areas, to achieve less memory
fragmentation. By putting less effort in finding a good fit for memory blocks
that are frequently allocated than for those less frequently allocated, a
performance gain can be achieved.

[](){: #alloc_util }

## The alloc_util Framework

Internally a framework called `alloc_util` is used for implementing allocators.
`sys_alloc` and `mseg_alloc` do not use this framework, so the following does
_not_ apply to them.

An allocator manages multiple areas, called carriers, in which memory blocks are
placed. A carrier is either placed in a separate memory segment (allocated
through `mseg_alloc`), or in the heap segment (allocated through `sys_alloc`).

- Multiblock carriers are used for storage of several blocks.
- Singleblock carriers are used for storage of one block.
- Blocks that are larger than the value of the singleblock carrier threshold
  ([`sbct`](erts_alloc.md#M_sbct)) parameter are placed in singleblock carriers.
- Blocks that are smaller than the value of parameter `sbct` are placed in
  multiblock carriers.

Normally an allocator creates a "main multiblock carrier". Main multiblock
carriers are never deallocated. The size of the main multiblock carrier is
determined by the value of parameter [`mmbcs`](erts_alloc.md#M_mmbcs).

[](){: #mseg_mbc_sizes } Sizes of multiblock carriers allocated through
`mseg_alloc` are decided based on the following parameters:

- The values of the largest multiblock carrier size
  ([`lmbcs`](erts_alloc.md#M_lmbcs))
- The smallest multiblock carrier size ([`smbcs`](erts_alloc.md#M_smbcs))
- The multiblock carrier growth stages ([`mbcgs`](erts_alloc.md#M_mbcgs))

If `nc` is the current number of multiblock carriers (the main multiblock
carrier excluded) managed by an allocator, the size of the next `mseg_alloc`
multiblock carrier allocated by this allocator is roughly
`smbcs+nc*(lmbcs-smbcs)/mbcgs` when `nc <= mbcgs`, and `lmbcs` when
`nc > mbcgs`. If the value of parameter `sbct` is larger than the value of
parameter `lmbcs`, the allocator may have to create multiblock carriers that are
larger than the value of parameter `lmbcs`, though. Singleblock carriers
allocated through `mseg_alloc` are sized to whole pages.

Sizes of carriers allocated through `sys_alloc` are decided based on the value
of the `sys_alloc` carrier size ([`ycs`](erts_alloc.md#Muycs)) parameter. The
size of a carrier is the least number of multiples of the value of parameter
`ycs` satisfying the request.

Coalescing of free blocks are always performed immediately. Boundary tags
(headers and footers) in free blocks are used, which makes the time complexity
for coalescing constant.

[](){: #strategy } The memory allocation strategy used for multiblock carriers
by an allocator can be configured using parameter [`as`](erts_alloc.md#M_as).
The following strategies are available:

- **Best fit** - Strategy: Find the smallest block satisfying the requested
  block size.

  Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of sizes of free blocks.

- **Address order best fit** - Strategy: Find the smallest block satisfying the
  requested block size. If multiple blocks are found, choose the one with the
  lowest address.

  Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.

- **Address order first fit** - Strategy: Find the block with the lowest address
  satisfying the requested block size.

  Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.

- **Address order first fit carrier best fit** - Strategy: Find the _carrier_
  with the lowest address that can satisfy the requested block size, then find a
  block within that carrier using the "best fit" strategy.

  Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.

- **Address order first fit carrier address order best fit** - Strategy: Find
  the _carrier_ with the lowest address that can satisfy the requested block
  size, then find a block within that carrier using the "address order best fit"
  strategy.

  Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.

- **Age order first fit carrier address order first fit** - Strategy: Find the
  _oldest carrier_ that can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block
  within that carrier using the "address order first fit" strategy.

  Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.

- **Age order first fit carrier best fit** - Strategy: Find the _oldest carrier_
  that can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block within that
  carrier using the "best fit" strategy.

  Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.

- **Age order first fit carrier address order best fit** - Strategy: Find the
  _oldest carrier_ that can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block
  within that carrier using the "address order best fit" strategy.

  Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are used. The time complexity is
  proportional to log N, where N is the number of free blocks.

- **Good fit** - Strategy: Try to find the best fit, but settle for the best fit
  found during a limited search.

  Implementation: The implementation uses segregated free lists with a maximum
  block search depth (in each list) to find a good fit fast. When the maximum
  block search depth is small (by default 3), this implementation has a time
  complexity that is constant. The maximum block search depth can be configured
  using parameter [`mbsd`](erts_alloc.md#M_mbsd).

- **A fit** - Strategy: Do not search for a fit, inspect only one free block to
  see if it satisfies the request. This strategy is only intended to be used for
  temporary allocations.

  Implementation: Inspect the first block in a free-list. If it satisfies the
  request, it is used, otherwise a new carrier is created. The implementation
  has a time complexity that is constant.

  As from ERTS 5.6.1 the emulator refuses to use this strategy on other
  allocators than `temp_alloc`. This because it only causes problems for other
  allocators.

Apart from the ordinary allocators described above, some pre-allocators are used
for some specific data types. These pre-allocators pre-allocate a fixed amount
of memory for certain data types when the runtime system starts. As long as
pre-allocated memory is available, it is used. When no pre-allocated memory is
available, memory is allocated in ordinary allocators. These pre-allocators are
typically much faster than the ordinary allocators, but can only satisfy a
limited number of requests.

[](){: #flags }

## System Flags Effecting erts_alloc

> #### Warning {: .warning }
>
> Only use these flags if you are sure what you are doing. Unsuitable settings
> can cause serious performance degradation and even a system crash at any time
> during operation.

Memory allocator system flags have the following syntax: `+M<S><P> <V>`, where
`<S>` is a letter identifying a subsystem, `<P>` is a parameter, and `<V>` is
the value to use. The flags can be passed to the Erlang emulator
([`erl(1)`](erl_cmd.md)) as command-line arguments.

System flags effecting specific allocators have an uppercase letter as `<S>`.
The following letters are used for the allocators:

- `B: binary_alloc`
- `D: std_alloc`
- `E: ets_alloc`
- `F: fix_alloc`
- `H: eheap_alloc`
- `I: literal_alloc`
- `L: ll_alloc`
- `M: mseg_alloc`
- `R: driver_alloc`
- `S: sl_alloc`
- `T: temp_alloc`
- `Y: sys_alloc`

### Flags for Configuration of mseg_alloc

- **`+MMamcbf <size>`{: #MMamcbf }** - Absolute maximum cache bad fit (in
  kilobytes). A segment in the memory segment cache is not reused if its size
  exceeds the requested size with more than the value of this parameter.
  Defaults to `4096`.

- **`+MMrmcbf <ratio>`{: #MMrmcbf }** - Relative maximum cache bad fit (in
  percent). A segment in the memory segment cache is not reused if its size
  exceeds the requested size with more than relative maximum cache bad fit
  percent of the requested size. Defaults to `20`.

- **`+MMsco true|false`{: #MMsco }** - Sets [super carrier](erts_alloc.md#MMscs)
  only flag. Defaults to `true`. When a super carrier is used and this flag is
  `true`, `mseg_alloc` only creates carriers in the super carrier. Notice that
  the `alloc_util` framework can create `sys_alloc` carriers, so if you want all
  carriers to be created in the super carrier, you therefore want to disable use
  of `sys_alloc` carriers by also passing [`+Musac false`](erts_alloc.md#Musac).
  When the flag is `false`, `mseg_alloc` tries to create carriers outside of the
  super carrier when the super carrier is full.

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > Setting this flag to `false` is not supported on all systems. The flag is
  > then ignored.

- **`+MMscrfsd <amount>`{: #MMscrfsd }** - Sets
  [super carrier](erts_alloc.md#MMscs) reserved free segment descriptors.
  Defaults to `65536`. This parameter determines the amount of memory to reserve
  for free segment descriptors used by the super carrier. If the system runs out
  of reserved memory for free segment descriptors, other memory is used. This
  can however cause fragmentation issues, so you want to ensure that this never
  happens. The maximum amount of free segment descriptors used can be retrieved
  from the `erts_mmap` tuple part of the result from calling
  [`erlang:system_info({allocator, mseg_alloc})`](`m:erlang#system_info_allocator_tuple`).

- **`+MMscrpm true|false`{: #MMscrpm }** - Sets
  [super carrier](erts_alloc.md#MMscs) reserve physical memory flag. Defaults to
  `true`. When this flag is `true`, physical memory is reserved for the whole
  super carrier at once when it is created. The reservation is after that left
  unchanged. When this flag is set to `false`, only virtual address space is
  reserved for the super carrier upon creation. The system attempts to reserve
  physical memory upon carrier creations in the super carrier, and attempt to
  unreserve physical memory upon carrier destructions in the super carrier.

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > What reservation of physical memory means, highly depends on the operating
  > system, and how it is configured. For example, different memory overcommit
  > settings on Linux drastically change the behavior.
  >
  > Setting this flag to `false` is possibly not supported on all systems. The
  > flag is then ignored.

- **`+MMscs <size in MB>`{: #MMscs }** - Sets super carrier size (in MB).
  Defaults to `0`, that is, the super carrier is by default disabled. The super
  carrier is a large continuous area in the virtual address space. `mseg_alloc`
  always tries to create new carriers in the super carrier if it exists. Notice
  that the `alloc_util` framework can create `sys_alloc` carriers. For more
  information, see [`+MMsco`](erts_alloc.md#MMsco).

- **`+MMmcs <amount>`{: #MMmcs }** - Maximum cached segments. The maximum number
  of memory segments stored in the memory segment cache. Valid range is
  `[0, 30]`. Defaults to `10`.

### Flags for Configuration of sys_alloc

- **`+MYe true`{: #MYe }** - Enables `sys_alloc`.

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > `sys_alloc` cannot be disabled.

- **`+MYtt <size>`{: #MYtt }** - Trim threshold size (in kilobytes). This is the
  maximum amount of free memory at the top of the heap (allocated by `sbrk`)
  that is kept by `malloc` (not released to the operating system). When the
  amount of free memory at the top of the heap exceeds the trim threshold,
  `malloc` releases it (by calling `sbrk`). Trim threshold is specified in
  kilobytes. Defaults to `128`.

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > This flag has effect only when the emulator is linked with the GNU C
  > library, and uses its `malloc` implementation.

- **`+MYtp <size>`{: #MYtp }** - Top pad size (in kilobytes). This is the amount
  of extra memory that is allocated by `malloc` when `sbrk` is called to get
  more memory from the operating system. Defaults to `0`.

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > This flag has effect only when the emulator is linked with the GNU C
  > library, and uses its `malloc` implementation.

### Flags for Configuration of Allocators Based on alloc_util

If `u` is used as subsystem identifier (that is, `<S> = u`), all allocators
based on `alloc_util` are effected. If `B`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `H`, `I`, `L`, `R`,
`S`, `T`, `X` is used as subsystem identifier, only the specific allocator
identifier is effected.

- **`+M<S>acul <utilization>|de`{: #M_acul }** - Abandon carrier utilization
  limit. A valid `<utilization>` is an integer in the range `[0, 100]`
  representing utilization in percent. When a utilization value > 0 is used,
  allocator instances are allowed to abandon multiblock carriers. If `de`
  (default enabled) is passed instead of a `<utilization>`, a recommended
  non-zero utilization value is used. The value chosen depends on the allocator
  type and can be changed between ERTS versions. Defaults to `de`, but this can
  be changed in the future.

  Carriers are abandoned when memory utilization in the allocator instance falls
  below the utilization value used. Once a carrier is abandoned, no new
  allocations are made in it. When an allocator instance gets an increased
  multiblock carrier need, it first tries to fetch an abandoned carrier from
  another allocator instance. If no abandoned carrier can be fetched, it creates
  a new empty carrier. When an abandoned carrier has been fetched, it will
  function as an ordinary carrier. This feature has special requirements on the
  [allocation strategy](erts_alloc.md#M_as) used. Only the strategies `aoff`,
  `aoffcbf`, `aoffcaobf`, `ageffcaoff`m, `ageffcbf` and `ageffcaobf` support
  abandoned carriers.

  This feature also requires
  [multiple thread specific instances](erts_alloc.md#M_t) to be enabled. When
  enabling this feature, multiple thread-specific instances are enabled if not
  already enabled, and the `aoffcbf` strategy is enabled if the current strategy
  does not support abandoned carriers. This feature can be enabled on all
  allocators based on the `alloc_util` framework, except `temp_alloc` (which
  would be pointless).

- **`+M<S>acfml <bytes>`{: #M_acfml }** - Abandon carrier free block min limit.
  A valid `<bytes>` is a positive integer representing a block size limit. The
  largest free block in a carrier must be at least `bytes` large, for the
  carrier to be abandoned. The default is zero but can be changed in the future.

  See also [`acul`](erts_alloc.md#M_acul).

- **`+M<S>acnl <amount>`{: #M_acnl }** - Abandon carrier number limit. A valid
  `<amount>` is a positive integer representing max number of abandoned carriers
  per allocator instance. Defaults to 1000 which will practically disable the
  limit, but this can be changed in the future.

  See also [`acul`](erts_alloc.md#M_acul).

- **`+M<S>acful <utilization>|de`{: #M_acful }** - Abandon carrier free
  utilization limit. When the utilization of a carrier falls belows this limit
  erts_alloc instructs the OS that unused memory in the carrier can be re-used
  for allocation by other OS procesesses. On Unix this is done by calling
  `madvise(..., ..., MADV_FREE)` on the unused memory region, on Windows it is
  done by calling `VirtualAlloc(..., ..., MEM_RESET, PAGE_READWRITE)`. Defaults
  to 0 which means that no memory will be marked as re-usable by the OS.

  A valid `<utilization>` is an integer in the range `[0, 100]` representing
  utilization in percent. If this value is larger than the `acul` limit it will
  be lowered to the current `acul` limit. If `de` (default enabled) is passed
  instead of a `<utilization>`, a recommended non-zero utilization value is
  used. The value chosen depends on the allocator type and can be changed
  between ERTS versions.

  See also [`acul`](erts_alloc.md#M_acul).

- **`+M<S>as bf|aobf|aoff|aoffcbf|aoffcaobf|ageffcaoff|ageffcbf|ageffcaobf|gf|af`{:
  #M_as }** - Allocation strategy. The following strategies are valid:

  - `bf` (best fit)
  - `aobf` (address order best fit)
  - `aoff` (address order first fit)
  - `aoffcbf` (address order first fit carrier best fit)
  - `aoffcaobf` (address order first fit carrier address order best fit)
  - `ageffcaoff` (age order first fit carrier address order first fit)
  - `ageffcbf` (age order first fit carrier best fit)
  - `ageffcaobf` (age order first fit carrier address order best fit)
  - `gf` (good fit)
  - `af` (a fit)

  See the description of allocation strategies in section
  [The alloc_util Framework](erts_alloc.md#strategy).

- **`+M<S>asbcst <size>`{: #M_asbcst }** - Absolute singleblock carrier shrink
  threshold (in kilobytes). When a block located in an `mseg_alloc` singleblock
  carrier is shrunk, the carrier is left unchanged if the amount of unused
  memory is less than this threshold, otherwise the carrier is shrunk. See also
  [`rsbcst`](erts_alloc.md#M_rsbcst).

- **`+M<S>atags true|false`{: #M_atags }** - Adds a small tag to each allocated
  block that contains basic information about what it is and who allocated it.
  Use the `m:instrument` module to inspect this information.

  The runtime overhead is two words per allocation when enabled. This may change
  at any time in the future.

  The default is `true` for `binary_alloc` and `driver_alloc`, and `false` for
  the other allocator types.

- **`+M<S>cp B|D|E|F|H||L|R|S|@|:`{: #M_cp }** - Set carrier pool to use for the
  allocator. Memory carriers will only migrate between allocator instances that
  use the same carrier pool. The following carrier pool names exist:

  - **`B`** - Carrier pool associated with `binary_alloc`.

  - **`D`** - Carrier pool associated with `std_alloc`.

  - **`E`** - Carrier pool associated with `ets_alloc`.

  - **`F`** - Carrier pool associated with `fix_alloc`.

  - **`H`** - Carrier pool associated with `eheap_alloc`.

  - **`L`** - Carrier pool associated with `ll_alloc`.

  - **`R`** - Carrier pool associated with `driver_alloc`.

  - **`S`** - Carrier pool associated with `sl_alloc`.

  - **`@`** - Carrier pool associated with the system as a whole.

  Besides passing carrier pool name as value to the parameter, you can also pass
  `:`. By passing `:` instead of carrier pool name, the allocator will use the
  carrier pool associated with itself. By passing the command line argument
  "`+Mucg :`", all allocators that have an associated carrier pool will use the
  carrier pool associated with themselves.

  The association between carrier pool and allocator is very loose. The
  associations are more or less only there to get names for the amount of
  carrier pools needed and names of carrier pools that can be easily identified
  by the `:` value.

  This flag is only valid for allocators that have an associated carrier pool.
  Besides that, there are no restrictions on carrier pools to use for an
  allocator.

  Currently each allocator with an associated carrier pool defaults to using its
  own associated carrier pool.

- **`+M<S>e true|false`{: #M_e }** - Enables allocator `<S>`.

- **`+M<S>lmbcs <size>`{: #M_lmbcs }** - Largest (`mseg_alloc`) multiblock
  carrier size (in kilobytes). See the description on how sizes for `mseg_alloc`
  multiblock carriers are decided in section
  [The alloc_util Framework](erts_alloc.md#mseg_mbc_sizes). On 32-bit Unix style
  OS this limit cannot be set > 64 MB.

- **`+M<S>mbcgs <ratio>`{: #M_mbcgs }** - (`mseg_alloc`) multiblock carrier
  growth stages. See the description on how sizes for `mseg_alloc` multiblock
  carriers are decided in section
  [The alloc_util Framework](erts_alloc.md#mseg_mbc_sizes).

- **`+M<S>mbsd <depth>`{: #M_mbsd }** - Maximum block search depth. This flag
  has effect only if the good fit strategy is selected for allocator `<S>`. When
  the good fit strategy is used, free blocks are placed in segregated
  free-lists. Each free-list contains blocks of sizes in a specific range. The
  maximum block search depth sets a limit on the maximum number of blocks to
  inspect in a free-list during a search for suitable block satisfying the
  request.

- **`+M<S>mmbcs <size>`{: #M_mmbcs }** - Main multiblock carrier size. Sets the
  size of the main multiblock carrier for allocator `<S>`. The main multiblock
  carrier is allocated through `sys_alloc` and is never deallocated.

- **`+M<S>mmmbc <amount>`{: #M_mmmbc }** - Maximum `mseg_alloc` multiblock
  carriers. Maximum number of multiblock carriers allocated through `mseg_alloc`
  by allocator `<S>`. When this limit is reached, new multiblock carriers are
  allocated through `sys_alloc`.

- **`+M<S>mmsbc <amount>`{: #M_mmsbc }** - Maximum `mseg_alloc` singleblock
  carriers. Maximum number of singleblock carriers allocated through
  `mseg_alloc` by allocator `<S>`. When this limit is reached, new singleblock
  carriers are allocated through `sys_alloc`.

- **`+M<S>ramv <bool>`{: #M_ramv }** - Realloc always moves. When enabled,
  reallocate operations are more or less translated into an allocate, copy, free
  sequence. This often reduces memory fragmentation, but costs performance.

- **`+M<S>rmbcmt <ratio>`{: #M_rmbcmt }** - Relative multiblock carrier move
  threshold (in percent). When a block located in a multiblock carrier is
  shrunk, the block is moved if the ratio of the size of the freed memory
  compared to the previous size is more than this threshold, otherwise the block
  is shrunk at the current location.

- **`+M<S>rsbcmt <ratio>`{: #M_rsbcmt }** - Relative singleblock carrier move
  threshold (in percent). When a block located in a singleblock carrier is
  shrunk to a size smaller than the value of parameter
  [`sbct`](erts_alloc.md#M_sbct), the block is left unchanged in the singleblock
  carrier if the ratio of unused memory is less than this threshold, otherwise
  it is moved into a multiblock carrier.

- **`+M<S>rsbcst <ratio>`{: #M_rsbcst }** - Relative singleblock carrier shrink
  threshold (in percent). When a block located in an `mseg_alloc` singleblock
  carrier is shrunk, the carrier is left unchanged if the ratio of unused memory
  is less than this threshold, otherwise the carrier is shrunk. See also
  [`asbcst`](erts_alloc.md#M_asbcst).

- **`+M<S>sbct <size>`{: #M_sbct }** - Singleblock carrier threshold (in
  kilobytes). Blocks larger than this threshold are placed in singleblock
  carriers. Blocks smaller than this threshold are placed in multiblock
  carriers. On 32-bit Unix style OS this threshold cannot be set > 8 MB.

- **`+M<S>smbcs <size>`{: #M_smbcs }** - Smallest (`mseg_alloc`) multiblock
  carrier size (in kilobytes). See the description on how sizes for `mseg_alloc`
  multiblock carriers are decided in section
  [The alloc_util Framework](erts_alloc.md#mseg_mbc_sizes).

- **`+M<S>t true|false`{: #M_t }** - Multiple, thread-specific instances of the
  allocator. Default behavior is `NoSchedulers+1` instances. Each scheduler uses
  a lock-free instance of its own and other threads use a common instance.

  Before ERTS 5.9 it was possible to configure a smaller number of
  thread-specific instances than schedulers. This is, however, not possible
  anymore.

### Flags for Configuration of alloc_util

All allocators based on `alloc_util` are effected.

- **`+Muycs <size>`{: #Muycs }** - `sys_alloc` carrier size. Carriers allocated
  through `sys_alloc` are allocated in sizes that are multiples of the
  `sys_alloc` carrier size. This is not true for main multiblock carriers and
  carriers allocated during a memory shortage, though.

- **`+Mummc <amount>`{: #Mummc }** - Maximum `mseg_alloc` carriers. Maximum
  number of carriers placed in separate memory segments. When this limit is
  reached, new carriers are placed in memory retrieved from `sys_alloc`.

- **`+Musac <bool>`{: #Musac }** - Allow `sys_alloc` carriers. Defaults to
  `true`. If set to `false`, `sys_alloc` carriers are never created by
  allocators using the `alloc_util` framework.

### Special Flag for literal_alloc

- **`+MIscs <size in MB>`{: #MIscs }** - `literal_alloc` super carrier size (in
  MB). The amount of _virtual_ address space reserved for literal terms in
  Erlang code on 64-bit architectures. Defaults to `1024` (that is, 1 GB), which
  is usually sufficient. The flag is ignored on 32-bit architectures.

### Instrumentation Flags

- **`+M<S>atags`** - Adds a small tag to each allocated block that contains
  basic information about what it is and who allocated it. See
  [`+M<S>atags`](erts_alloc.md#M_atags) for a more complete description.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> When instrumentation of the emulator is enabled, the emulator uses more memory
> and runs slower.

### Other Flags

- **`+Mea min|max|r9c|r10b|r11b|config`{: #Mea }** - Options:

  - **`min`** - Disables all allocators that can be disabled.

  - **`max`** - Enables all allocators (default).

  - **`r9c|r10b|r11b`** - Configures all allocators as they were configured in
    respective Erlang/OTP release. These will eventually be removed.

- **`+Mlpm all|no`{: #Mlpm }** - Lock physical memory. Defaults to `no`, that
  is, no physical memory is locked. If set to `all`, all memory mappings made by
  the runtime system are locked into physical memory. If set to `all`, the
  runtime system fails to start if this feature is not supported, the user has
  not got enough privileges, or the user is not allowed to lock enough physical
  memory. The runtime system also fails with an out of memory condition if the
  user limit on the amount of locked memory is reached.

- **`+Mdai max|<amount>`{: #Mdai }** - Set amount of dirty allocator instances
  used. Defaults to `0`. That is, by default no instances will be used. The
  maximum amount of instances equals the amount of dirty CPU schedulers on the
  system.

  By default, each normal scheduler thread has its own allocator instance for
  each allocator. All other threads in the system, including dirty schedulers,
  share one instance for each allocator. By enabling dirty allocator instances,
  dirty schedulers will get and use their own set of allocator instances. Note
  that these instances are not exclusive to each dirty scheduler, but instead
  shared among dirty schedulers. The more instances used the less risk of lock
  contention on these allocator instances. Memory consumption do however
  increase with increased amount of dirty allocator instances.

## Notes

Only some default values have been presented here. For information about the
currently used settings and the current status of the allocators, see
[`erlang:system_info(allocator)`](`m:erlang#system_info_allocator`) and
[`erlang:system_info({allocator, Alloc})`](`m:erlang#system_info_allocator_tuple`).
