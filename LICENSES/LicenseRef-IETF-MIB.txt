MIB modules published in IETF RFCs prior to the adoption of BCP 78 (such as
RFC 1158) are considered to be freely copyable and usable for implementation
and interoperability purposes. No explicit license was provided, but the IETF
intended for MIB code to be reusable and modifiable as necessary.

This interpretation is based on historical practice and later IETF
clarification that such material was meant to be in the public domain or
under permissive terms.
