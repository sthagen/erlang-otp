## Visualizing Message Sequence Charts

The easiest way of using `ET`, is to just use it as a graphical tool for
displaying message sequence charts. In order to do that you need to first start
a `Viewer` (which by default starts a `Collector`):

```erlang
      {ok, ViewerPid} = et_viewer:start([{title,"Coffee Order"}]),
      CollectorPid = et_viewer:get_collector_pid(ViewerPid).
```

[](){: #report_event }

Then you send events to the `Collector` with the function
`et_collector:report_event/6` like this:

```text
      et_collector:report_event(CollectorPid,85,from,to,message,extra_stuff).
```

The `Viewer` will automatically pull events from the `Collector` and display
them on the screen.

The number (in this case 85) is an integer from 1 to 100 that specifies the
"detail level" of the message. The higher the number, the more important it is.
This provides a crude form of priority filtering.

The `from`, `to`, and `message` parameters are exactly what they sound like.
`from` and `to` are visualized in the `Viewer` as "lifelines", with the message
passing from one to the other. If `from` and `to` are the same value, then it is
displayed next to the lifeline as an "action". The `extra_stuff `value is simply
data that you can attach that will be displayed when someone actually clicks on
the action or message in the `Viewer` window.

The module `et/examples/et_display_demo.erl` illustrates how it can be used:

```erlang

-module(et_display_demo).

-export([test/0]).

test() ->
    {ok, Viewer} = et_viewer:start([{title,"Coffee Order"}, {max_actors,10}]),
    Drink = {drink,iced_chai_latte},
    Size = {size,grande},
    Milk = {milk,whole},
    Flavor = {flavor,vanilla},
    C = et_viewer:get_collector_pid(Viewer),
    et_collector:report_event(C,99,customer,barrista1,place_order,[Drink,Size,Milk,Flavor]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista1,register,enter_order,[Drink,Size,Flavor]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,register,barrista1,give_total,"$5"),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista1,barrista1,get_cup,[Drink,Size]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista1,barrista2,give_cup,[]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,90,barrista1,customer,request_money,"$5"),
    et_collector:report_event(C,90,customer,barrista1,pay_money,"$5"),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista2,barrista2,get_chai_mix,[]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista2,barrista2,add_flavor,[Flavor]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista2,barrista2,add_milk,[Milk]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista2,barrista2,add_ice,[]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista2,barrista2,swirl,[]),
    et_collector:report_event(C,80,barrista2,customer,give_tasty_beverage,[Drink,Size]),
    ok.
```

When you run the `et_display_demo:test().` function in the example above, the
`Viewer` window will look like this:

## Four Modules

The event tracer framework is made up of four modules:

- `et`
- `et_collector`
- `et_viewer`
- `et_selector`

In addition, you'll probably want to familiarize yourself with the `dbg` module
and possibly `seq_trace` module as well.

## The Event Tracer Interface

The `et` module is not like other modules. It contains a function called
`et:trace_me/5`. Which is a function that does not do any useful stuff at all.
Its sole purpose is to be a function that is easy to trace. A call to it may be
something like:

```text
      et:trace_me(85,from,to,message,extra_stuff).
```

The parameters to `et:trace_me/5` are the same as to
[`et_collector:report_event/6`](et_tutorial.md#report_event) in the previous
chapter. The big difference between the two is in the semantics of the two
functions. The second actually reports an `Event` to the `Collector` while the
first does nothing, it just returns the atom `hopefully_traced`. In order to
make the parameters to `et:trace_me/5` turn up in the `Collector`, tracing of
that function must be activated and the `Collector` must be registered as a
`Tracer` of the `Raw Trace Data`.

Erlang tracing is a seething pile of pain that involves reasonably complex
knowledge of clever ports, tracing return formats, and specialized tracing
`MatchSpecs` (which are really their own special kind of hell). The tracing
mechanism is very powerful indeed, but it can be hard to grasp.

Luckily there is a simplified way to start tracing of `et:trace_me/5` function
calls. The idea is that you should instrument your code with calls to
`et:trace_me/5` in strategic places where you have interesting information
available in your program. Then you just start the `Collector` with global
tracing enabled:

```erlang
      et_viewer:start([{trace_global, true}, {trace_pattern, {et,max}}]).
```

This will start a `Collector`, a `Viewer` and also start the tracing of
`et:trace_me/5` function calls. The `Raw Trace Data` is collected by the
`Collector` and a view of it is displayed on the screen by the `Viewer`. You can
define your own "views" of the data by implementing your own `Filter` functions
and register them in the `Viewer`.

## The Collector and Viewer

These two pieces work in concert. Basically, the `Collector` receives
`Raw Trace Data` and processes it into `Events` in a `et` specific format
(defined in `et/include/et.hrl`). The `Viewer` interrogates the `Collector` and
displays an interactive representation of the data.

You might wonder why these aren't just one module. The `Collector` is a generic
full-fledged framework that allows processes to "subscribe" to the `Events` that
it collects. One `Collector` can serve several `Viewers`. The typical case is
that you have one `Viewer` that visualizes `Events` in one flavor and another
`Viewer` that visualizes them in another flavor. If you for example are tracing
a text based protocol like `HTML` (or `Megaco/H.248`) it would be useful to be
able to display the `Events` as plain text as well as the internal
representation of the message. The architecture does also allow you to implement
your own `Viewer` program as long as it complies to the protocol between the
`Collector/Viewer` protocol. Currently two kinds of `Viewers` exists. That is
the old `GS` based one and the new based on `wxWidgets`. But if you feel for it
you may implement your own `Viewer`, which for example could display the
`Events` as ASCII art or whatever you feel useful.

The `Viewer` will by default create a `Collector` for you. With a few options
and some configuration settings you can start collecting `Events`.

The `Collector` API does also allow you to save the collected `Events` to file
and later load them in a later session.

## The Selector

This is perhaps the most central module in the entirety of the `et` suite. The
`Collector` needs "filters" to convert the `Raw Trace Data` into "events" that
it can display. The `et_selector` module provides the default `Filter` and some
API calls to manage the `Trace Pattern`. The `Selector` provides various
functions that achieve the following:

- Convert `Raw Trace Data` into an appropriate `Event`
- Magically notice traces of the `et:trace_me/5` function and make appropriate
  `Events`
- Carefully prevent translating the `Raw Trace Data` twice
- Manage a `Trace Pattern`

The `Trace Pattern` is basically a tuple of a `module` and a `detail level`
(either an integer or the atom max for full detail). In most cases the
`Trace Pattern` `{et,max}` does suffice. But if you do not want any runtime
dependency of `et` you can implement your own `trace_me/5` function in some
module and refer to that module in the `Trace Pattern`.

The specified module flows from your instantiation of the `Viewer`, to the
`Collector` that it automatically creates, gets stashed in as the
`Trace Pattern`, and eventually goes down into the bowels of the `Selector`.

The module that you specify gets passed down (eventually) into `Selector`'s
default `Filter`. The format of the `et:trace_me/5` function call is hardcoded
in that `Filter`.

## How To Put It Together

The `Collector` automatically registers itself to listen for trace `Events`, so
all you have to do is enable them.

For those people who want to do general tracing, consult the `dbg` module on how
to trace whatever you're interested in and let it work its magic. If you just
want `et:trace_me/5` to work, do the following:

1. Create a `Collector`
1. Create a `Viewer` (this can do step #1 for you)
1. Turn on and pare down debugging

The module `et/examples/et_trace_demo.erl` achieves this.

```erlang

-module(et_trace_demo).

-export([test/0]).

test() ->
    et_viewer:start([
        {title,"Coffee Order"},
        {trace_global,true},
        {trace_pattern,{et,max}},
        {max_actors,10}
      ]),
      %% dbg:p(all,call),
      %% dbg:tpl(et, trace_me, 5, []),
      Drink = {drink,iced_chai_latte},
      Size = {size,grande},
      Milk = {milk,whole},
      Flavor = {flavor,vanilla},
      et:trace_me(99,customer,barrista1,place_order,[Drink,Size,Milk,Flavor]),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista1,register,enter_order,[Drink,Size,Flavor]),
      et:trace_me(80,register,barrista1,give_total,"$5"),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista1,barrista1,get_cup,[Drink,Size]),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista1,barrista2,give_cup,[]),
      et:trace_me(90,barrista1,customer,request_money,"$5"),
      et:trace_me(90,customer,barrista1,pay_money,"$5"),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista2,barrista2,get_chai_mix,[]),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista2,barrista2,add_flavor,[Flavor]),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista2,barrista2,add_milk,[Milk]),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista2,barrista2,add_ice,[]),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista2,barrista2,swirl,[]),
      et:trace_me(80,barrista2,customer,give_tasty_beverage,[Drink,Size]),
      ok.
```

Running through the above, the most important points are:

- Turn on global tracing
- Set a `Trace Pattern`
- Tell `dbg` to trace function Calls
- Tell it specifically to trace the `et:trace_me/5` function

When you run the `et_trace_demo:test()` function above, the `Viewer` window will
look like this screenshot:
