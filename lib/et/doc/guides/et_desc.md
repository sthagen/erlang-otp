# Description

## Overview

The two major components of the `Event Tracer (ET)` tool is a graphical sequence
chart viewer (`et_viewer`) and its backing storage (`et_collector`). One
`Collector` may be used as backing storage for several simultaneous `Viewers`
where each one may display a different view of the same trace data.

The interface between the `Collector` and its `Viewers` is public in order to
enable other types of `Viewers`. However in the following text we will focus on
usage of the `et_viewer`.

The main start function is `et_viewer:start/1`. By default it will start both an
`et_collector` and an `et_viewer`:

```erlang
% erl -pa et/examples
Erlang R13B03 (erts-5.7.4) [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [rq:4] [async-threads:0] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.7.4  (abort with ^G)
1> {ok, Viewer} = et_viewer:start([]).
{ok,<0.40.0>}
```

A `Viewer` gets trace `Events` from its `Collector` by polling it regularly for
more `Events` to display. `Events` are for example reported to the `Collector`
with `et_collector:report_event/6`:

```erlang
2> Collector = et_viewer:get_collector_pid(Viewer).
<0.39.0>
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 60, my_shell, mnesia_tm, start_outer,
3>                           "Start outer transaction"),
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 40, mnesia_tm, my_shell, new_tid,
3>                           "New transaction id is 4711"),
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 20, my_shell, mnesia_locker, try_write_lock,
3>                           "Acquire write lock for {my_tab, key}"),
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 10, mnesia_locker, my_shell, granted,
3>                           "You got the write lock for {my_tab, key}"),
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 60, my_shell, do_commit,
3>                           "Perform  transaction commit"),
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 40, my_shell, mnesia_locker, release_tid,
3>                           "Release all locks for transaction 4711"),
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 60, my_shell, mnesia_tm, delete_transaction,
3>                           "End of outer transaction"),
3> et_collector:report_event(Collector, 20, my_shell, end_outer,
3>                           "Transaction returned {atomic, ok}").
{ok,{table_handle,<0.39.0>,16402,trace_ts,
     #Fun<et_collector.0.62831470>}}
```

This actually is a simulation of the process `Events` caused by a `Mnesia`
transaction that writes a record in a local table:

```erlang
mnesia:transaction(fun() -> mnesia:write({my_tab, key, val}) end).
```

At this stage when we have a couple of `Events`, it is time to show how it looks
like in the graphical interface of `et_viewer`:

![A simulated Mnesia transaction which writes one record](assets/sim_trans.png "A simulated Mnesia transaction which writes one record")

In the sequence chart, the actors (which symbolically has performed the `Event`)
are shown as named vertical bars. The order of the actors may be altered by
dragging (hold mouse button 1 pressed during the operation) the name tag of an
actor and drop it elsewhere:

![Two actors has switched places](assets/sim_trans_move_actor.png "Two actors has switched places")

An `Event` may be an action performed by one single actor (blue text label) or
it may involve two actors and is then depicted as an arrow directed from one
actor to another (red text label). Details of an `Event` can be shown by
clicking (press and release the mouse button 1) on the event label text or on
the arrow. When doing that a `Contents Viewer` window pops up. It may look like
this:

![Details of a write lock message](assets/sim_trans_write_lock.png "Details of a write lock message")

## Filters and dictionary

The `Event Tracer (ET)` uses named filters in various contexts. An Event Trace
filter is an `Erlang fun` that takes some trace data as input and returns a
possibly modified version of it:

```erlang
filter(TraceData) -> false | true | {true, NewEvent}

TraceData = Event | erlang_trace_data()
Event = #event{}
NewEvent = #event{}
```

The interface of the filter function is the same as the the filter functions for
the good old `lists:filtermap/2`. If the filter returns `false` it means that
the trace data should silently be dropped. `true` means that the trace data data
already is an `Event Record` and that it should be kept as it is. `true` means
that the `TraceData` already is an `Event Record` and that it should be kept as
it is. `{true, NewEvent}` means that the original trace data should be replaced
with `Event`. This provides means to get rid of unwanted `Events` as well as
enabling alternate views of an `Event`.

The first filter that the trace data is exposed for is the `Collector Filter`.
When a trace `Event` is reported with `et_collector:report/2` (or
`et_collector:report_event/5,6`) the first thing that happens, is that a message
is sent to the `Collector` process to fetch a handle that contains some useful
stuff, such as the `Collector Filter Fun` and an Ets table identifier. Then the
`Collector Filter Fun` is applied and if it returns `true` (or
`{true, NewEvent}`), the `Event` will be stored in an Ets table. As an
optimization, subsequent calls to `et_collector:report`\-functions can use the
handle directly instead of the `Collector Pid`.

All filters (registered in a `Collector` or in a `Viewer`) must be able to
handle an `Event record` as input. The `Collector Filter` (that is the filter
named `all`) is a little bit special, as its input also may be raw
`Erlang Trace Data`

The `Collector` manages a key/value based dictionary, where the filters are
stored. Updates of the dictionary is propagated to all subscribing processes.
When a `Viewer` is started it is registered as a subscriber of dictionary
updates.

In each `Viewer` there is only one filter that is active and all trace `Events`
that the `Viewer` gets from the `Collector` will pass thru that filter. By
writing clever filters it is possible to customize how the `Events` looks like
in the viewer. The following filter in `et/examples/et_demo.erl` replaces the
actor names `mnesia_tm` and `mnesia_locker` and leaves everything else in the
record as it was:

```erlang

mgr_actors(E) when is_record(E, event) ->
    Actor = fun(A) ->
               case A of
                   mnesia_tm     -> trans_mgr;
                   mnesia_locker -> lock_mgr;
                   _             -> A
               end
            end,
    {true, E#event{from = Actor(E#event.from),
                   to = Actor(E#event.to),
                   contents = [{orig_from, E#event.from},
                               {orig_to,   E#event.to},
                               {orig_contents, E#event.contents}]}}.
```

If we now add the filter to the running `Collector`:

```erlang
4> Fun = fun(E) -> et_demo:mgr_actors(E) end.
#Fun<erl_eval.6.13229925>
5> et_collector:dict_insert(Collector, {filter, mgr_actors}, Fun).
ok
```

you will see that the `Filter` menu in all viewers have got a new entry called
`mgr_actors`. Select it, and a new `Viewer` window will pop up:

![The same trace data in a different view](assets/sim_trans_mgr_actors.png "The same trace data in a different view")

In order to see the nitty gritty details of an `Event` you may click on the
`Event` in order to start a `Contents Viewer` for that `Event`. In the
`Contents Viewer` there also is a filter menu that enables inspection of the
`Event` from other views than the one selected in the viewer. A click on the
`new_tid` `Event` will cause a `Contents Viewer` window to pop up, showing the
`Event` in the `mgr_actors` view:

![The trace Event in the mgr_actors view](assets/sim_trans_contents_viewer_mgr_actors.png "The trace Event in the mgr_actors view")

Select the `all` entry in the `Filters` menu and a new `Contents Viewer window`
will pop up showing the same trace `Event` in the collectors view:

![The same trace Event in the collectors view](assets/sim_trans_contents_viewer_collector.png "The same trace Event in the collectors view")

## Trace clients

As you have seen, it is possible to use the `et_collector:report_event/5,6`
functions explicitly. By using those functions you can write your own trace
client that reads trace data from any source stored in any format and just feed
the `Collector` with it. You may replace the default `Collector Filter` with a
filter that converts new exciting trace data formats to `Event Records` or you
may convert it to an `Event Record` before you invoke `et_collector:report/2`
and then rely on the default `Collector Filter` to handle the new format.

There are also existing functions in the API that reads from various sources and
calls `et_collector:report/2`:

- The trace `Events` that are hosted by the `Collector` may be stored to file
  and later be loaded by selecting `save` and `load` entries in the `Viewers`
  `File` menu or via the `et_collector` API.
- It is also possible to perform live tracing of a running system by making use
  of the built-in trace support in the Erlang emulator. These Erlang traces can
  be directed to files or to ports. See the reference manual for
  `erlang:trace/3`, `erlang:trace_pattern/3`, `dbg` and `ttb` for more info.

  There are also corresponding trace client types that can read the Erlang trace
  data format from such files or ports. The `et_collector:start_trace_client/3`
  function makes use of these Erlang trace clients and redirects the trace data
  to the `Collector`.

  The default `Collector Filter` converts the raw Erlang trace data format into
  `Event Records`. If you want to perform this differently you can of course
  write your own `Collector Filter` from scratch. But it may probably save you
  some efforts if you first apply the default filter in
  `et_selector:parse_event/2` before you apply your own conversions of its
  output.

## Global tracing

Setting up an Erlang tracer on a set of nodes and connecting trace clients to
the ports of these tracers is not intuitive. In order to make this it easier the
`Event Tracer` has a notion of global tracing. When used, the `et_collector`
process will monitor Erlang nodes and when one connects, an Erlang tracer will
automatically be started on the newly connected node. A corresponding trace
client will also be started on the `Collector` node in order to automatically
forward the trace `Events` to the `Collector`. Set the boolean parameter
`trace_global` to `true` for either the `et_collector` or `et_viewer` in order
to activate the global tracing. There is no restriction on how many concurrent
(anonymous) collectors you can have, but you can only have one _global_
`Collector` as its name is registered in `global`.

In order to further simplify the tracing, you can make use of the
`et:trace_me/4,5` functions. These functions are intended to be invoked from
other applications when there are interesting `Events`, in your application that
needs to be highlighted. The functions are extremely light weight as they do
nothing besides returning an atom. These functions are specifically designed to
be traced for. As the caller explicitly provides the values for the
`Event Record` fields, the default `Collector Filter` is able to automatically
provide a customized `Event Record` without any user defined filter functions.

In normal operation, the `et:trace_me/4,5` calls are almost for free. When
tracing is needed, you can either activate tracing on these functions
explicitly. Or you can combine the usage of `trace_global` with the usage of
`trace_pattern`. When set, the `trace_pattern` will automatically be activated
on all connected nodes.

One nice thing with the `trace_pattern` is that it provides a very simple way of
minimizing the amount of generated trace data by allowing you to explicitly
control the detail level of the tracing. As you may have seen the `et_viewer`
have a slider called `"Detail Level"` that allows you to control the detail
level of the trace `Events` displayed in the `Viewer`. On the other hand if you
set a low detail level in the `trace_pattern`, lots of the trace data will never
be generated and thus not sent over the socket to the trace client and stored in
the `Collector`.

## Viewer window

Almost all functionality available in the `et_viewer` is also available via
shortcuts. Which key that has the same effect as selecting a menu entry is shown
enclosed in parentheses. For example pressing the key `r` is equivalent to
selecting the menu entry `Viewer->Refresh`.

File menu:

- `Clear all events in the Collector` \- Deletes all `Events` stored in the
  `Collector` and notifies all connected `Viewers` about this.
- `Load events to the Collector from file` \- Loads the `Collector` with
  `Events` from a file and notifies all connected `Viewers` about this.
- `Save all events in the Collector to file` \- Saves all `Events` stored in the
  `Collector` to file.
- `Print setup` \- Enables editing of printer setting, such as paper and layout.
- `Print current page` \- Prints the events on the current page. The page size
  is dependent of the selected paper type.
- `Print all pages` \- Prints all events. The page size is dependent of the
  selected paper type.
- `Close this Viewer` \- Closes this `Viewer` window, but keeps all other
  `Viewers` windows and the `Collector` process.
- `Close other Viewers, but this` \- Keeps this `Viewer` window and its
  `Collector` process, but closes all other `Viewers` windowsconnected to the
  same `Collector`.
- `Close all Viewers and the Collector` \- Closes the `Collector` and all
  `Viewers` connected to it.

Viewer menu:

- `First` \- Scrolls `this` viewer to the first `Event` in the `Collector`.
- `Last` \- Scrolls `this` viewer to the last `Event` in the `Collector`.
- `Prev` \- Scrolls `this` viewer one page backwards.
- `Next` \- Scrolls `this` viewer one page forward.
- `Refresh` \- Clears `this` viewer and re-read its `Events` from the
  `Collector`.
- `Up` \- Scrolls a few `Events` backwards.
- `Down` \- Scrolls a few `Events` forward.
- `Display all actors.` \- Reset the settings for hidden and/or highlighted
  actors.

Collector menu:

- `First` \- Scrolls`all` viewers to the first `Event` in the `Collector`.
- `Last` \- Scrolls `all` viewers to the last `Event` in the `Collector`.
- `Prev` \- Scrolls `all` viewers one page backwards.
- `Next` \- Scrolls `all` viewers one page forward.
- `Refresh` \- Clears `all` viewers and re-read their `Events` from the
  `Collector`.

Filters and scaling menu:

- `ActiveFilter (=)` \- Starts a new `Viewer` window with the same active filter
  and scale as the current one.
- `ActiveFilter (+)` \- Starts a new `Viewer` window with the same active filter
  but a larger scale than the current one.
- `ActiveFilter (-)` \- Starts a new `Viewer `window with the same active filter
  but a smaller scale than the current one.
- `all (0)` \- Starts a new `Viewer` with the `Collector Filter` as active
  filter. It will cause all events in the collector to be viewed.
- `AnotherFilter (2)` \- If more filters are inserted into the dictionary, these
  will turn up here as entries in the `Filters` menu. The second filter will get
  the shortcut number 2, the next one number 3 etc. The names are sorted.

Slider and radio buttons:

- `Hide From=To` \- When true, this means that the `Viewer` will hide all
  `Events` where the from-actor equals to its to-actor. These events are
  sometimes called actions.
- `Hide (excluded actors)` \- When true, this means that the `Viewer` will hide
  all `Events` whose actors are marked as excluded. Excluded actors are normally
  enclosed in round brackets when they are displayed in the `Viewer`.
- `Detail level` \- This slider controls the resolution of the `Viewer`. Only
  `Events` with a detail level `smaller` than the selected one (default=100=max)
  are displayed.

Other features:

- `Vertical scroll` \- Use mouse wheel and up/down arrows to scroll little. Use
  page up/down and home/end buttons to scroll more.
- `Display details of an event` \- Left mouse click on the event label or the
  arrowand a new `Contents Viewer` window will pop up, displaying the contents
  of an `Event`.
- `Highlight actor (toggle)` \- Left mouse click on the actor name tag. The
  actor name will be enclosed in square brackets `[]`. When one or more actors
  are highlighted, only events related to those actors are displayed. All others
  are hidden.
- `Exclude actor (toggle)` \- Right mouse click on the actor name tag. The actor
  name will be enclosed in round brackets `()`. When an actor is excluded, all
  events related to this actor is hidden. If the checkbox
  `Hide (excluded actors)` is checked, even the name tags and corresponding
  vertical line of excluded actors will be hidden.
- `Move actor` \- Left mouse button drag and drop on actor name tag. Move the
  actor by first clicking on the actor name, keeping the button pressed while
  moving the cursor to a new location and release the button where the actor
  should be moved to.
- `Display all actors` \- Press the 'a' button. Reset the settings for hidden
  and/or highlighted actors.

## Configuration

The `Event Records` in the Ets table are ordered by their timestamp. Which
timestamp that should be used is controlled via the `event_order` parameter.
Default is `trace_ts` which means the time when the trace data was generated.
`event_ts` means the time when the trace data was parsed (transformed into an
`Event Record`).

## Contents viewer window

File menu:

- `Close` \- Close this window.
- `Save` \- Save the contents of this window to file.

Filters menu:

- `ActiveFilter` \- Start a new `Contents Viewer window` with the same active
  filter.
- `AnotherFilter (2)` \- If more filters are inserted into the dictionary, these
  will turn up here as entries in the `Filters` menu. The second filter will be
  number 2, the next one number 3 etc. The names are sorted.

Hide menu:

- `Hide actor in viewer` \- Known actors are shown as a named vertical bars in
  the `Viewer` window. By hiding the actor, its vertical bar will be removed and
  the `Viewer` will be refreshed.

  `Hiding the actor` is only useful if the `max_actors` threshold has been
  reached, as it then will imply that the "hidden" actor will be displayed as if
  it were `"UNKNOWN"`. If the `max_actors` threshold not have been reached, the
  actor will re-appear as a vertical bar in the `Viewer`.

- `Show actor in viewer` \- This implies that the actor will be added as a known
  actor in the `Viewer` with its own vertical bar.

Search menu:

- `Forward from this event` \- Set this event to be the first event in the
  viewer and change its display mode to be enter forward search mode. The actor
  of this event (from, to or both) will be added to the list of selected actors.
- `Reverse from this event` \- Set this event to be the first `Event` in the
  `Viewer` and change its display mode to be enter reverse search mode. The
  actor of this `Event` (from, to or both) will be added to the list of selected
  actors. Observe, that the `Events` will be shown in reverse order.
- `Abort search. Display all` \- Switch the display mode of the `Viewer` to show
  all `Events` regardless of any ongoing searches. Abort the searches.
