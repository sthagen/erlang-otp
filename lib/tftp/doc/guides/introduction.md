# Introduction

## Purpose

The Trivial File Transfer Protocol or TFTP is a very simple protocol used to
transfer files.

It has been implemented on top of the User Datagram protocol (UDP) so it may be
used to move files between machines on different networks implementing UDP. It
is designed to be small and easy to implement. Therefore, it lacks most of the
features of a regular FTP. The only thing it can do is read and write files (or
mail) from/to a remote server. It cannot list directories, and currently has no
provisions for user authentication.

The `tftp` application implements the following IETF standards:

- RFC 1350, The TFTP Protocol (revision 2)
- RFC 2347, TFTP Option Extension
- RFC 2348, TFTP Blocksize Option
- RFC 2349, TFTP Timeout Interval and Transfer Size Options

The only feature that not is implemented is the `netascii` transfer mode.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang programming language,
concepts of OTP, and has a basic understanding of the TFTP protocol.
