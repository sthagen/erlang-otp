# FTP Release Notes

## Ftp 1.2.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Dialyzer warnings due to type specs added in `m:dbg` have been eliminated.

  Own Id: OTP-18860

### Improvements and New Features

- The documentation has been migrated to use Markdown and ExDoc.

  Own Id: OTP-18955 Aux Id: [PR-8026]

[PR-8026]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8026

## Ftp 1.2.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Fix race condition that sometimes resulted in ftp:recv_bin/2 returning ok instead of \{ok, Data\}.

  Own Id: OTP-19119 Aux Id: GH-8454 ,PR-8543

## Ftp 1.2.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Replaced unintentional Erlang Public License 1.1 headers in some files with
  the intended Apache License 2.0 header.

  Own Id: OTP-18815 Aux Id: PR-7780

## Ftp 1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixes the documentation for the `ftp` module and updates the typing of `ftp`
  functions that return errors.

  The documentation has been improved and the types of the functions are now
  read from source code, instead of being hard-coded in XML.

  Functions returning errors of the form `{error, Reason :: 'ehost' | ...}` are
  now similar to other modules, i.e., `{error, Reason :: term()}`. If one wants
  to understand the error, one must call the function
  `ftp:formaterror({error, Reason})`.

  Own Id: OTP-18359 Aux Id: PR-6545

### Improvements and New Features

- Deprecates `dbg:stop_clear/0` because it is simply a function alias to
  `dbg:stop/0`

  Own Id: OTP-18478 Aux Id: GH-6903

- Remove deprecated functions in OTP-26

  Own Id: OTP-18541

## Ftp 1.1.4

### Improvements and New Features

- Replace size/1 with either tuple_size/1 or byte_size/1

  The [`size/1`](`size/1`) BIF is not optimized by the JIT, and its use can
  result in worse types for Dialyzer.

  When one knows that the value being tested must be a tuple,
  [`tuple_size/1`](`tuple_size/1`) should always be preferred.

  When one knows that the value being tested must be a binary,
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) should be preferred. However,
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) also accepts a bitstring (rounding up size to a
  whole number of bytes), so one must make sure that the call to `byte_size/` is
  preceded by a call to [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) to ensure that bitstrings
  are rejected. Note that the compiler removes redundant calls to
  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`), so if one is not sure whether previous code
  had made sure that the argument is a binary, it does not harm to add an
  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) test immediately before the call to
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`).

## Ftp 1.1.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixes calls to `ftp:nlist/2` returning `{error, epath}` when the file / folder
  exists

  Own Id: OTP-18409 Aux Id: PR-6721,ERIERL-908

## Ftp 1.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- fix unexpected result `ok` when calling `ftp:nlist` repeatedly

  Own Id: OTP-18252 Aux Id: GH-5823

## Ftp 1.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- An unexpected timeout message on the FTP control channel was observed in a
  real system and could not be associated with anything that was expected to
  happen, so we will ignore but info log such unexpected messages.

  Own Id: OTP-17989 Aux Id: ERIERL-767

## Ftp 1.1
