# Standards Compliance

The table below summarizes the diameter application's compliance with RFC 6733.
Since the diameter application isn't a Diameter node on its own, compliance is
strictly the responsibility of the user in many cases, diameter providing the
means for the user to be compliant rather than being compliant on its own.

The Compliance column notes _C_ (Compliant) if the required functionality is
implemented, _PC_ (Partially Compliant) if there are limitations, _NC_ (Not
Compliant) if functionality is not implemented, or a dash if text is
informational or only places requirements that must be met by the user's
implementation.

Capitalized _Diameter_ refers to the protocol, lowercase _diameter_ to the
Erlang application.
