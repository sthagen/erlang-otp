# Introduction

## Purpose

The Public Key application deals with public-key related file formats, digital
signatures, and [X-509 certificates](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt). It is
a library application that provides encode/decode, sign/verify, encrypt/decrypt,
and similar functionality. It does not read or write files, it expects or
returns file contents or partial file contents as binaries.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang programming language
and has a basic understanding of the concepts of using public-keys and digital
certificates.

## Performance Tips

The Public Key decode- and encode-functions try to use the NIFs in the ASN.1
compilers runtime modules, if they can be found. Thus, to have the ASN1
application in the path of your system gives the best performance.
