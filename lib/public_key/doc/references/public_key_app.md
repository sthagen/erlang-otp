signature and verification functions, validation of certificate paths and
certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and other functions for handling of
certificates, keys and CRLs.

## DEPENDENCIES

The `public_key` application uses the Crypto application to perform
cryptographic operations and the ASN-1 application to handle PKIX-ASN-1
specifications, hence these applications must be loaded for the `public_key`
application to work. In an embedded environment this means they must be started
with `application:start/[1,2]` before the `public_key` application is started.

## ERROR LOGGER AND EVENT HANDLERS

The `public_key` application is a library application and does not use the error
logger. The functions will either succeed or fail with a runtime error.
