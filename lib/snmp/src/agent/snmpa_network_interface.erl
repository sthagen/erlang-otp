Behaviour module for the SNMP agent network interface.

This module defines the behaviour of the agent network interface. A
`snmpa_network_interface` compliant module must export the following functions:

- [start_link/4](`m:snmpa_network_interface#start_link`)
- [info/1](`m:snmpa_network_interface#info`)
- [get_log_type/1](`m:snmpa_network_interface#get_log_type`)
- [set_log_type/2](`m:snmpa_network_interface#set_log_type`)
- [verbosity/2](`m:snmpa_network_interface#verbosity`)

The semantics of them and their exact signatures are explained below.

But this is not enough. There is also a set of _mandatory_ messages which the
network interface entity must be able to receive and be able to send. This is
described in chapter [snmp_agent_netif](snmp_agent_netif.md).

[](){: #start_link }
""".

%% Note that this behaviour is not enough!
%% There is also a set of mandatory messages which the
%% network interface entity must be able to receive and
%% be able to send. See the documentation for more info.

-doc """
Start-link the network interface process.

`NoteStore` is the pid of the note-store process and `MasterAgent` is the pid of
the master-agent process.

`Opts` is an (basically) implementation dependent list of options to the network
interface process. There are however a number of options which _must_ be
handled: `versions` and `verbosity`.

The info returned is basically up to the implementer to decide. This
implementation provided by the application provides info about memory allocation
and various socket information.

The info returned by this function is returned together with other info
collected by the agent when the [info](`m:snmpa#info`) function is called
(tagged with with the key `net_if`).
