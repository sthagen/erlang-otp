Behaviour module for the SNMP agent discovery handler.

This module defines the behaviour of the agent discovery handler. A
`snmpa_discovery_handler` compliant module must export the following functions:

- [stage1_finish/2](`m:snmpa_discovery_handler#stage1_finish`)

The semantics of them and their exact signatures are explained below.

[](){: #stage1_finish }
""".

-export([verify/1]).

-doc """
This function is called at the end of stage 1 of the discovery process. It
should return either the atom `ignore` or `{ok, usm_entry() | [usm_entry()]}`.
See [usm_entry()](snmp_agent_config_files.md#usm) and
[usm_entry/13](`m:snmpa_conf#usm_entry`) for more info.

If the function returns `ignore`, then it is assumed that either:

- The caller (of the discovery function) will make the needed updates later.
- The callback function itself did the updates.

In either case, the agent will do nothing, but return the retrieved
ManagerEngineID (see [discovery](`m:snmpa#discovery`) for more info) and
possible continue with stage 2 of the discovery process.

The `ExtraInfo` argument is passed on from the [discovery](`m:snmpa#discovery`)
function.

This function may return an updated `NewExtraInfo` that will be used in
subsequent calls to the callback functions. Intended for future use.

The purpose of this function is to generate the usm- related security data
needed for usm processing in the agent. Specifically, updating the usmUserTable.

When an `usm_entry()` tuple (or a list of such tuples) is returned, this data is
then added to the `usmUserTable` by the (master-) agent.

When an `usm_entry()` tuple (or a list of such tuples) is returned, this data is
then added to the `usmUserTable` by the (master-) agent.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> Note that the function does not check if this entry already exists.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> Note that this function is executed in the context of the master-agent
> process.
