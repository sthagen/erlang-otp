-module(snmpa_notification_delivery_info_receiver).
-moduledoc """
Behaviour module for the SNMP agent notification delivery information receiver.

This module defines the behaviour of the notification delivery information
receiver.

A `snmpa_notification_delivery_info_receiver` compliant module must export the
following functions:

- `c:delivery_targets/3`
- `c:delivery_info/4`

The semantics of them and their exact signatures are explained below.

Legacy notification delivery information receiver modules used a target argument
on the form `{IpAddr, PortNumber}` instead of `{Domain, Addr}`, and if the SNMP
Agent is run without changing the configuration to use transport domains the
notification delivery information receiver will still get the old arguments and
work as before.

## DATA TYPES

See the [data types in `snmpa_conf`](`m:snmpa_conf#types`).

[](){: #accept_recv } [](){: #delivery_targets }

Inform about delivery result.

This function is called for each target in the `Targets` argument of the
[`delivery_targets/3`](`c:delivery_targets/3`) function, see above.

The purpose is to inform the `receiver` of the result of the delivery (was the
notification acknowledged or not) for each target.
