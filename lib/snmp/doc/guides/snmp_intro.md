# SNMP Introduction

The SNMP development toolkit contains the following parts:

- An Extensible multi-lingual SNMP agent, which understands SNMPv1 (RFC1157),
  SNMPv2c (RFC1901, 1905, 1906 and 1907), SNMPv3 (RFC2271, 2272, 2273, 2274 and
  2275), or any combination of these protocols.
- A multi-lingual SNMP manager.
- A MIB compiler, which understands SMIv1 (RFC1155, 1212, and 1215) and SMIv2
  (RFC1902, 1903, and 1904).

The SNMP development tool provides an environment for rapid agent/manager
prototyping and construction. With the following information provided, this tool
is used to set up a running multi-lingual SNMP agent/manager:

- a description of a Management Information Base (MIB) in Abstract Syntax
  Notation One (ASN.1)
- instrumentation functions for the managed objects in the MIB, written in
  Erlang.

The advantage of using an extensible (agent/manager) toolkit is to remove
details such as type-checking, access rights, Protocol Data Unit (PDU),
encoding, decoding, and trap distribution from the programmer, who only has to
write the instrumentation functions, which implement the MIBs. The `get-next`
function only has to be implemented for tables, and not for every variable in
the global naming tree. This information can be deduced from the ASN.1 file.

## Scope and Purpose

This manual describes the SNMP development tool, as a component of the
Erlang/Open Telecom Platform development environment. It is assumed that the
reader is familiar with the Erlang Development Environment, which is described
in a separate User's Guide.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for understanding the material in the
SNMP User's Guide:

- the basics of the Simple Network Management Protocol version 1 (SNMPv1)
- the basics of the community-based Simple Network Management Protocol version 2
  (SNMPv2c)
- the basics of the Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3)
- the knowledge of defining MIBs using SMIv1 and SMIv2
- familiarity with the Erlang system and Erlang programming

The tool requires Erlang release 4.7 or later.

## Definitions

The following definitions are used in the SNMP User's Guide.

- **MIB** - The conceptual repository for management information is called the
  Management Information Base (MIB). It does not hold any data, merely a
  definition of what data can be accessed. A definition of an MIB is a
  description of a collection of managed objects.

- **SMI** - The MIB is specified in an adapted subset of the Abstract Syntax
  Notation One (ASN.1) language. This adapted subset is called the Structure of
  Management Information (SMI).

- **ASN.1** - ASN.1 is used in two different ways in SNMP. The SMI is based on
  ASN.1, and the messages in the protocol are defined by using ASN.1.

- **Managed object** - A resource to be managed is represented by a managed
  object, which resides in the MIB. In an SNMP MIB, the managed objects are
  either:

  - _scalar variables_, which have only one instance per context. They have
    single values, not multiple values like vectors or structures.
  - _tables_, which can grow dynamically.
  - a _table element_, which is a special type of scalar variable.

- **Operations** - SNMP relies on the three basic operations: get (object), set
  (object, value) and get-next (object).

- **Instrumentation function** - An instrumentation function is associated with
  each managed object. This is the function, which actually implements the
  operations and will be called by the agent when it receives a request from the
  management station.

- **Manager** - A manager generates commands and receives notifications from
  agents. There usually are only a few managers in a system.

- **Agent** - An agent responds to commands from the manager, and sends
  notification to the manager. There are potentially many agents in a system.

## About This Manual

In addition to this introductory chapter, the SNMP User's Guide contains the
following chapters:

- Chapter 2: "Functional Description" describes the features and operation of
  the SNMP development toolkit. It includes topics on Sub-agents and MIB
  loading, Internal MIBs, and Traps.
- Chapter 3: "The MIB Compiler" describes the features and the operation of the
  MIB compiler.
- Chapter 4: "Running the application" describes how to start and configure the
  application. Topics on how to debug the application are also included.
- Chapter 5: "Definition of Agent Configuration Files" is a reference chapter,
  which contains more detailed information about the agent configuration files.
- Chapter 6: "Definition of Manager Configuration Files" is a reference chapter,
  which contains more detailed information about the manager configuration
  files.
- Chapter 7: "Agent Implementation Example" describes how an MIB can be
  implemented with the SNMP Development Toolkit. Implementation examples are
  included.
- Chapter 8: "Instrumentation Functions" describes how instrumentation functions
  should be defined in Erlang for the different operations.
- Chapter 9: "Definition of Instrumentation Functions" is a reference chapter
  which contains more detailed information about the instrumentation functions.
- Chapter 10: "Definition of Agent Net if" is a reference chapter, which
  describes the Agent Net if function in detail.
- Chapter 11: "Definition of Manager Net if" is a reference chapter, which
  describes the Manager Net if function in detail.
- Chapter 12: "Advanced Agent Topics" describes sub-agents, agent semantics,
  audit trail logging, and the consideration of distributed tables.
- Appendix A describes the conversion of SNMPv2 to SNMPv1 error messages.
- Appendix B contains the RFC1903 text on `RowStatus`.
