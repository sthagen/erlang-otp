# SNMP Appendix A

## Appendix A

This appendix describes the conversion of SNMPv2 to SNMPv1 error messages. The
instrumentation functions should return v2 error messages.

Mapping of SNMPv2 error message to SNMPv1:

| SNMPv2 message      | SNMPv1 message |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| noError             | noError        |
| genErr              | genErr         |
| noAccess            | noSuchName     |
| wrongType           | badValue       |
| wrongLength         | badValue       |
| wrongEncoding       | badValue       |
| wrongValue          | badValue       |
| noCreation          | noSuchName     |
| inconsistentValue   | badValue       |
| resourceUnavailable | genErr         |
| commitFailed        | genErr         |
| undoFailed          | genErr         |
| notWritable         | noSuchName     |
| inconsistentName    | noSuchName     |
