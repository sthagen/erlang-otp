# Error handling

## Strategy

On a conceptual level starting a database connection using the Erlang ODBC API
is a basic client server application. The client process uses the API to start
and communicate with the server process that manages the connection. The
strategy of the Erlang ODBC application is that programming faults in the
application itself will cause the connection process to terminate
abnormally.(When a process terminates abnormally its supervisor will log
relevant error reports.) Calls to API functions during or after termination of
the connection process, will return `{error, connection_closed}`. Contextual
errors on the other hand will not terminate the connection it will only return
`{error, Reason} `to the client, where `Reason` may be any erlang term.

### Clients

The connection is associated with the process that created it and can only be
accessed through it. The reason for this is to preserve the semantics of result
sets and transactions when select_count/\[2,3] is called or auto_commit is
turned off. Attempts to use the connection from another process will fail. This
will not effect the connection. On the other hand, if the client process dies
the connection will be terminated.

### Timeouts

All request made by the client to the connection are synchronous. If the timeout
is used and expires the client process will exit with reason timeout. Probably
the right thing to do is let the client die and perhaps be restarted by its
supervisor. But if the client chooses to catch this timeout, it is a good idea
to wait a little while before trying again. If there are too many consecutive
timeouts that are caught the connection process will conclude that there is
something radically wrong and terminate the connection.

### Guards

All API-functions are guarded and if you pass an argument of the wrong type a
runtime error will occur. All input parameters to internal functions are trusted
to be correct. It is a good programming practise to only distrust input from
truly external sources. You are not supposed to catch these errors, it will only
make the code very messy and much more complex, which introduces more bugs and
in the worst case also covers up the actual faults. Put your effort on testing
instead, you should trust your own input.

## The whole picture

As the Erlang ODBC application relies on third party products and communicates
with a database that probably runs on another computer in the network there are
plenty of things that might go wrong. To fully understand the things that might
happen it facilitate to know the design of the Erlang ODBC application, hence
here follows a short description of the current design.

![Architecture of the Erlang odbc application](assets/odbc_app_arc.gif "Architecture of the Erlang odbc application")

When you do application:start(odbc) the only thing that happens is that a
supervisor process is started. For each call to the API function connect/2 a
process is spawned and added as a child to the Erlang ODBC supervisor. The
supervisors only tasks are to provide error-log reports, if a child process
should die abnormally, and the possibility to do a code change. Only the client
process has the knowledge to decide if this connection managing process should
be restarted.

The erlang connection process spawned by connect/2, will open a port to a
c-process that handles the communication with the database through Microsoft's
ODBC API. The erlang port will be kept open for exit signal propagation, if
something goes wrong in the c-process and it exits we want know as mush as
possible about the reason. The main communication with the c-process is done
through sockets. The C-process consists of two threads, the supervisor thread
and the database handler thread. The supervisor thread checks for shutdown
messages on the supervisor socket and the database handler thread receives
requests and sends answers on the database socket. If the database thread seems
to hang on some database call, the erlang control process will send a shutdown
message on the supervisor socket, in this case the c-process will exit. If the
c-process crashes/exits it will bring the erlang-process down too and vice versa
i.e. the connection is terminated.

### Error types

The types of errors that may occur can be divide into the following categories.

- Configuration problems - Everything from that the database was not set up
  right to that the c-program that should be run through the erlang port was not
  compiled for your platform.
- Errors discovered by the ODBC driver - If calls to the ODBC-driver fails due
  to circumstances that cannot be controlled by the Erlang ODBC application
  programmer, an error string will be dug up from the driver. This string will
  be the `Reason` in the `{error, Reason} `return value. How good this error
  message is will of course be driver dependent. Examples of such circumstances
  are trying to insert the same key twice, invalid SQL-queries and that the
  database has gone off line.
- Connection termination - If a connection is terminated in an abnormal way, or
  if you try to use a connection that you have already terminated in a normal
  way by calling disconnect/1, the return value will
  be`{error, connection_closed}`. A connection could end abnormally because of
  an programming error in the Erlang ODBC application, but also if the ODBC
  driver crashes.
- Contextual errors - If API functions are used in the wrong context, the
  `Reason` in the error tuple will be a descriptive atom. For instance if you
  try to call the function `last/[1,2] `without first calling
  `select_count/[2,3] `to associate a result set with the connection. If the
  ODBC-driver does not support some functions, or if you disabled some
  functionality for a connection and then try to use it.
