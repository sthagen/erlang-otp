queue_use.erl:18:20: The call queue:is_empty({[], []}) does not have an opaque term of type queue:queue(_) as 1st argument
queue_use.erl:22:18: The call queue:in(42,Q0::{[],[]}) does not have an opaque term of type queue:queue(_) as 2nd argument
queue_use.erl:27:5: The attempt to match a term of type queue:queue(_) against the pattern {"*", Q2} breaks the opacity of the term
queue_use.erl:33:5: Attempt to test for equality between a term of type {[42,...],[]} and a term of opaque type queue:queue(_)
queue_use.erl:36:5: The attempt to match a term of type queue:queue(_) against the pattern {F, _R} breaks the opacity of the term
queue_use.erl:40:35: The call queue:out({"*", []}) does not have an opaque term of type queue:queue(_) as 1st argument
queue_use.erl:52:2: The pattern 'true' can never match the type 'false'
queue_use.erl:56:24: The attempt to match a term of type queue:queue(_) against the pattern {L1, L2} breaks the opacity of the term
queue_use.erl:62:17: The call queue_use:tuple_queue({42, 'gazonk'}) does not have a term of type {_,queue:queue(_)} (with opaque subterms) as 1st argument
queue_use.erl:62:17: The call queue_use:tuple_queue({42, 'gazonk'}) will never return since it differs in the 1st argument from the success typing arguments: ({_,queue:queue(_)})
queue_use.erl:65:17: The call queue:in(F::42,Q::'gazonk') does not have an opaque term of type queue:queue(_) as 2nd argument
queue_use.erl:65:17: The call queue:in(F::42,Q::'gazonk') will never return since the success typing is (any(),{maybe_improper_list(),maybe_improper_list()}) -> {nonempty_maybe_improper_list(),maybe_improper_list()} and the contract is (Item,Q1::queue(Item)) -> Q2::queue(Item)
