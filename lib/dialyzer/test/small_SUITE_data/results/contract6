contract6.erl:28:2: Invalid type specification for function contract6:swap/1.
 The success typing is contract6:swap(_) -> none()
 But the spec is contract6:swap(#r{}) -> #r{}
 They do not overlap in the 1st argument
contract6.erl:29:1: Function swap/1 has no local return
contract6.erl:29:1: Matching of pattern {'r', T1, T2} tagged with a record name violates the declared type of any()
