  [;1m                       Fun :: function(),[0m
  [;1m                       Options :: [spawn_opt_option()].[0m

  Returns the process identifier (pid) of a new process started by
  the application of [;;4mFun[0m to the empty list [;;4m[][0m. Otherwise works
  like [;;4mspawn_opt/4[0m.

  If option [;;4mmonitor[0m is specified, the newly created process is
  monitored, and both the pid and reference for the monitor are
  returned.
