[;1mÂ Â pid_to_list(Pid)[0m

  Returns a string corresponding to the text representation of [;;4mPid[0m.

  For example:

    > erlang:pid_to_list(self()).
    "<0.85.0>"

  [;;4mNote[0m

    The creation for the node is not included in the list
    representation of [;;4mPid[0m. This means that processes in
    different incarnations of a node with a specific name can get
    the same list representation.
