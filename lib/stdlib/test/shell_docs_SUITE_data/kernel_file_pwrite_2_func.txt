[;1mÂ Â pwrite(IoDevice, LocBytes)[0m

  Performs a sequence of [;;4mpwrite/3[0m in one operation, which is more
  efficient than calling them one at a time. Returns [;;4mok[0m or [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, {N, Reason}}[0m, where [;;4mN[0m is the number of successful
  writes done before the failure.

  When positioning in a file with other [;;4mencoding[0m than [;;4mlatin1[0m,
  caution must be taken to set the position on a correct character
  boundary. For details, see [;;4mposition/2[0m.
