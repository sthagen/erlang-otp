[;1mÂ Â iolist()[0m

  A list containing bytes and/or iodata.

  This datatype is used to represent data that is meant to be output
  using any I/O module. For example: [;;4mfile:write/2[0m or [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mgen_tcp:send/2[0m.

  In most use cases you want to use [;;4miodata/0[0m instead of this type.
