[;1mÂ Â relation(Tuples)[0m

  Equivalent to [;;4mrelation(Tuples, Type)[0m where [;;4mType[0m is the size of
  the first tuple of [;;4mTuples[0m is used if there is such a tuple.

  If tuples is [;;4m[][0m, then [;;4mType[0m is [;;4m2[0m.

[;1mÂ Â relation(Tuples, Type)[0m

  Creates a relation. [;;4mrelation(R,Â T)[0m is equivalent to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfrom_term(R,Â T)[0m, if T is a type and the result is a relation.

  If [;;4mType[0m is an integer N, then [;;4m[{atom,Â ...,Â atom}])[0m, where the
  tuple size is N, is used as type of the relation.
