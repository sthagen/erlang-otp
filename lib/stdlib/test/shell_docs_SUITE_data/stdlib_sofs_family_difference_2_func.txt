  If [;;4mFamily1[0m and [;;4mFamily2[0m are families, then [;;4mFamily3[0m is the
  family such that the index set is equal to the index set of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mFamily1[0m, and [;;4mFamily3[0m[i] is the difference between [;;4mFamily1[0m[i]
  and [;;4mFamily2[0m[i] if [;;4mFamily2[0m maps i, otherwise [;;4mFamily1[i][0m.
