[;1mÂ Â projection(SetFun, Set1)[0m

  Returns the set created by substituting each element of [;;4mSet1[0m by
  the result of applying [;;4mSetFun[0m to the element.

  If [;;4mSetFun[0m is a number iÂ >=Â 1 and [;;4mSet1[0m is a relation, then the
  returned set is the projection of [;;4mSet1[0m onto coordinate i.

    1> S1 = sofs:from_term([{1,a},{2,b},{3,a}]),
    S2 = sofs:projection(2, S1),
    sofs:to_external(S2).
