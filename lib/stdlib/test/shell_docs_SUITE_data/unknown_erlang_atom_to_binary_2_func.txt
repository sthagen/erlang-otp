[;1mÂ Â atom_to_binary(Atom, Encoding)[0m

  Returns a binary corresponding to the text representation of [;;4mAtom[0m.

  If [;;4mEncoding[0m is [;;4mlatin1[0m, one byte exists for each character in
  the text representation. If [;;4mEncoding[0m is [;;4mutf8[0m or [;;4municode[0m, the
  characters are encoded using UTF-8 where characters may require
  multiple bytes.

  [;;4mChange[0m

    As from Erlang/OTP 20, atoms can contain any Unicode character
    and [;;4matom_to_binary(Atom, latin1)[0m may fail if the text
    representation for [;;4mAtom[0m contains a Unicode character > 255.

  Example:

    > atom_to_binary('Erlang', latin1).
    <<"Erlang">>
