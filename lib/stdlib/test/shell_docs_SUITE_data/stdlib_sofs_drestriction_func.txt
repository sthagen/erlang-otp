[;1mÂ Â drestriction(BinRel1, Set)[0m

  Returns the difference between the binary relation [;;4mBinRel1[0m and
  the restriction of [;;4mBinRel1[0m to [;;4mSet[0m.

    1> R1 = sofs:relation([{1,a},{2,b},{3,c}]),
    S = sofs:set([2,4,6]),
    R2 = sofs:drestriction(R1, S),
    sofs:to_external(R2).
    [{1,a},{3,c}]

  [;;4mdrestriction(R,Â S)[0m is equivalent to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mdifference(R,Â restriction(R,Â S))[0m.

[;1mÂ Â drestriction(SetFun, Set1, Set2)[0m

  Returns a subset of [;;4mSet1[0m containing those elements that do not
  give an element in [;;4mSet2[0m as the result of applying [;;4mSetFun[0m.

    1> SetFun = {external, fun({_A,B,C}) -> {B,C} end},
    R1 = sofs:relation([{a,aa,1},{b,bb,2},{c,cc,3}]),
