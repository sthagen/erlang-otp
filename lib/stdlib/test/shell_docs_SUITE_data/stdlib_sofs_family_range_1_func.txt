[;1mÂ Â family_range(Family1)[0m

  If [;;4mFamily1[0m is a family and [;;4mFamily1[0m[i] is a binary relation for
  every i in the index set of [;;4mFamily1[0m, then [;;4mFamily2[0m is the
  family with the same index set as [;;4mFamily1[0m such that [;;4mFamily2[0m[i]
  is the range of [;;4mFamily1[0m[i].
