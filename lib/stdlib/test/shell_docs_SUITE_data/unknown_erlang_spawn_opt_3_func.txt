[;1mÂ Â spawn_opt(Node, Fun, Options)[0m

  Returns the process identifier (pid) of a new process started by
  the application of [;;4mFun[0m to the empty list [;;4m[][0m on [;;4mNode[0m. If [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mNode[0m does not exist, a useless pid is returned. Otherwise works
  like [;;4mspawn_opt/4[0m.

  Valid options depends on what options are supported by the node
  identified by [;;4mNode[0m. A description of valid [;;4mOption[0ms for the
  local node of current OTP version can be found in the
  documentation of [;;4mspawn_opt/4[0m.
