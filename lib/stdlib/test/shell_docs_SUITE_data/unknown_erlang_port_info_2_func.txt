[;1mÂ Â port_info(Port, Item)[0m

  Returns information about [;;4mPort[0m.

  If the port identified by [;;4mPort[0m is not open, [;;4mundefined[0m is
  returned. If the port is closed and the calling process was
  previously linked to the port, the exit signal from the port is
  guaranteed to be delivered before [;;4mport_info/2[0m returns [;;4mundefined[0m.

  [;;4mItem[0m is one of the following and can be used to get various
  information about the [;;4mPort[0m.

   â€¢ [;;4mconnected[0m - returns [;;4m{connected, Pid}[0m where [;;4mPid[0m is the
     process identifier of the process connected to the port.

   â€¢ [;;4mid[0m - returns [;;4m{id, Index}[0m where [;;4mIndex[0m is the internal
     index of the port. This index can be used to separate ports.

   â€¢ [;;4minput[0m - returns [;;4m{input, Bytes}[0m where [;;4mBytes[0m is the total
     number of bytes read from the port.

   â€¢ [;;4mlinks[0m - returns [;;4m{links, Pids}[0m where [;;4mPids[0m is a list of
     the process identifiers of the processes that the port is
     linked to.

   â€¢ [;;4mlocking[0m - returns [;;4m{locking, Locking}[0m where [;;4mLocking[0m is
     one of the following:

      ï¿® [;;4mport_level[0m (port-specific locking)

      ï¿® [;;4mdriver_level[0m (driver-specific locking) Notice that
        these results are highly implementation-specific and
        can change in a future release.

     Since: OTP R16B

   â€¢ [;;4mmemory[0m - returns [;;4m{memory, Bytes}[0m where [;;4mBytes[0m is the
     total number of bytes allocated for this port by the runtime
     system. The port itself can have allocated memory that is
     not included in [;;4mBytes[0m.

   â€¢ [;;4mmonitors[0m - returns [;;4m{monitors, Monitors}[0m where [;;4mMonitors[0m
     represent processes monitored by this port.

     Since: OTP R16B

   â€¢ [;;4mmonitored_by[0m - returns [;;4m{monitored_by, MonitoredBy}[0m where [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mMonitoredBy[0m is a list of pids that are monitoring given
     port at the moment.

     Since: OTP 19.0

   â€¢ [;;4mname[0m - returns [;;4m{name, Name}[0m where [;;4mName[0m is the command
     name set by [;;4mopen_port/2[0m.

   â€¢ [;;4mos_pid[0m - returns [;;4m{os_pid, OsPid}[0m where [;;4mOsPid[0m is the
     process identifier (or equivalent) of an OS process created
     with [;;4mopen_port({spawn | spawn_executable, Command},[0m
     [;;4mOptions)[0m. If the port is not the result of spawning an OS
     process, the value is [;;4mundefined[0m.

     Since: OTP R16B

   â€¢ [;;4moutput[0m - returns [;;4m{output, Bytes}[0m where [;;4mBytes[0m is the
     total number of bytes written to the port from Erlang
     processes using [;;4mport_command/2[0m, [;;4mport_command/3[0m, or [;;4mPort ![0m
     [;;4m{Owner, {command, Data}[0m.

   â€¢ [;;4mparallelism[0m - returns [;;4m{parallelism, Boolean}[0m where [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mBoolean[0m corresponds to the port parallelism hint used by
     this port. For more information, see option [;;4mparallelism[0m of [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mopen_port/2[0m.

     Since: OTP R16B

   â€¢ [;;4mqueue_size[0m - returns [;;4m{queue_size, Bytes}[0m where [;;4mBytes[0m is
     the total number of bytes queued by the port using the ERTS
     driver queue implementation.

     Since: OTP R16B

   â€¢ [;;4mregistered_name[0m - returns [;;4m{registered_name,[0m
     [;;4mRegisteredName}[0m where [;;4mRegisteredName[0m is the registered
     name of the port. If the port has no registered name, [;;4m[][0m
     is returned.

  Failure: [;;4mbadarg[0m if [;;4mPort[0m is not a local port identifier, or an
  atom.
