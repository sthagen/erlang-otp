[;1mÂ Â trace_pattern(MFA, MatchSpec, FlagList)[0m

  Set trace pattern for call, send and receive tracing on the static

  [;;4mChange[0m

    This function is superseded by [;;4mtrace:function/4[0m, [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mtrace:send/3[0m and

    [;;4mtrace:recv/3[0m that operate on dynamic trace sessions.

  Argument [;;4mFlagList[0m can contain two additional options for call
  tracing:

   â€¢ [;;4m{meta, Pid} | {meta, TracerModule, TracerState}[0m - Turns on
     or off meta-tracing for all types of function calls. Trace
     messages are sent to the tracer whenever any of the
     specified functions are called. If no tracer is specified, [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mself/0[0m is used as a default tracer process.

  For further documentation see [;;4mtrace:function/4[0m , [;;4mtrace:send/3[0m
  and [;;4mtrace:recv/3[0m.
