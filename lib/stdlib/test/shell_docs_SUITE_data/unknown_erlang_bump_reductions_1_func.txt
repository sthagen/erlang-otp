  This implementation-dependent function increments the reduction
  counter for the calling process.

  In the Beam emulator, the reduction counter is normally
  incremented by one for each function and BIF call. A context
  switch is forced when the counter reaches the maximum number of
  reductions for a process (4000 reductions in Erlang/OTP 19.2 and
  later).

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    This BIF can be removed in a future version of the Beam
    machine without prior warning. It is unlikely to be
    implemented in other Erlang implementations.
