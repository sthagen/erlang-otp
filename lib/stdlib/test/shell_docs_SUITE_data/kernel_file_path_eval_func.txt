[;1mÂ Â path_eval(Path, Filename)[0m

  Searches the path [;;4mPath[0m (a list of directory names) until the
  file [;;4mFilename[0m is found. If [;;4mFilename[0m is an absolute filename, [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mPath[0m is ignored. Then reads and evaluates Erlang expressions,
  separated by [;;4m.[0m (or [;;4m,[0m, a sequence of expressions is also an
  expression), from the file. The result of evaluation is not
  returned; any expression sequence in the file must be there for
  its side effect.

  Returns one of the following:

   â€¢ [;;4m{ok, FullName}[0m - The file is read and evaluated. [;;4mFullName[0m
     is the full name of the file.

   â€¢ [;;4m{error, enoent}[0m - The file cannot be found in any of the
     directories in [;;4mPath[0m.

   â€¢ [;;4m{error, atom()}[0m - An error occurred when opening the file
     or reading it. For a list of typical error codes, see [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mopen/2[0m.

   â€¢ [;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m - An error occurred when
     interpreting the Erlang expressions in the file. Use [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mformat_error/1[0m to convert the three-element tuple to an
     English description of the error.

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment as described in [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mepp[0m.

  The documentation for path_eval/3 is hidden. This probably means
  that it is internal and not to be used by other applications.
