[;1mÂ Â spawn_opt(Node, Module, Function, Args, Options)[0m

  Returns the process identifier (pid) of a new process started by
  the application of [;;4mModule:Function[0m to [;;4mArgs[0m on [;;4mNode[0m. If [;;4mNode[0m
  does not exist, a useless pid is returned. Otherwise works like [;;4m[0m

  Valid options depends on what options are supported by the node
  identified by [;;4mNode[0m. A description of valid [;;4mOption[0ms for the
  local node of current OTP version can be found in the
  documentation of [;;4mspawn_opt/4[0m.
