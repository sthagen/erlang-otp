[;1mÂ Â set_cookie(Node, Cookie)[0m

  Sets the magic cookie for [;;4mNode[0m to the atom [;;4mCookie[0m. If [;;4mNode[0m
  is the local node, the function sets the cookie of all other nodes
  (that have no explicit cookie set with this function) to [;;4mCookie[0m.

  See section Distributed Erlang in the Erlang Reference Manual in
  System Documentation for more information.

  You can get this value using [;;4mget_cookie/1[0m.

  Failure: [;;4mfunction_clause[0m if the local node is not alive.
