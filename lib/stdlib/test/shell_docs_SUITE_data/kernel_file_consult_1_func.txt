  of the following:

   â€¢ [;;4m{ok, Terms}[0m - The file was successfully read.

   â€¢ [;;4m{error, atom()}[0m - An error occurred when opening the file
     or reading it. For a list of typical error codes, see [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mopen/2[0m.

   â€¢ [;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m - An error occurred when
     interpreting the Erlang terms in the file. To convert the
     three-element tuple to an English description of the error,
     use [;;4mformat_error/1[0m.

  Example:

    f.txt:  {person, "kalle", 25}.
            {person, "pelle", 30}.

    1> file:consult("f.txt").
    {ok,[{person,"kalle",25},{person,"pelle",30}]}

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment, as described
  in [;;4mepp[0m.
