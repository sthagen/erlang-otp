  The Erlang BIFs and predefined types.

  By convention, most Built-In Functions (BIFs) and all predefined
  types are included in this module. Some of the BIFs and all of the
  predefined types are viewed more or less as part of the Erlang
  programming language and are auto-imported. Thus, it is not
  necessary to specify the module name. For example, the calls [;;4m[0m
  [;;4matom_to_list(erlang)[0m and [;;4merlang:atom_to_list(erlang)[0m are
  identical.

  Auto-imported BIFs are annotated with [;;4mauto-imported[0m and
  predefined types are annotated with [;;4mpredefined[0m.

  Some auto-imported BIFs are also allowed in guard expression. Such
  BIFs are annoted with both [;;4mauto-imported[0m and [;;4mguard-bif[0m.

  BIFs can fail for various reasons. All BIFs fail with reason [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mbadarg[0m if they are called with arguments of an incorrect type.
  The other reasons are described in the description of each
  individual BIF.
