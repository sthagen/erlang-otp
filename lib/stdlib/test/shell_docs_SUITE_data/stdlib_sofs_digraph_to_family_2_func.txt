[;1mÂ Â digraph_to_family(Graph, Type)[0m

  Creates a family from the directed graph [;;4mGraph[0m.

  Each vertex a of [;;4mGraph[0m is represented by a pair
  (a,Â {b[1],Â ...,Â b[n]}), where the b[i]:s are the out-neighbors of

   â€¢ It is assumed that [;;4mType[0m is a valid type of the external
     set of the family.

  If G is a directed graph, it holds that the vertices and edges of
  G are the same as the vertices and edges of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfamily_to_digraph(digraph_to_family(G))[0m.
