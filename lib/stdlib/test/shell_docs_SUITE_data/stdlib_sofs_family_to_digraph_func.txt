[;1mÂ Â family_to_digraph(Family)[0m

  There is no documentation for family_to_digraph(Family, [])

[;1mÂ Â family_to_digraph(Family, GraphType)[0m

  Creates a directed graph from family [;;4mFamily[0m.

  For each pair (a,Â {b[1],Â ...,Â b[n]}) of [;;4mFamily[0m, vertex a and the
  edges (a,Â b[i]) for 1Â <=Â iÂ <=Â n are added to a newly created
  directed graph.

  [;;4mGraphType[0m is passed on to [;;4mdigraph:new/1[0m.

  It F is a family, it holds that F is a subset of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mdigraph_to_family(family_to_digraph(F),Â type(F))[0m. Equality holds
  if [;;4munion_of_family(F)[0m is a subset of [;;4mdomain(F)[0m.

  Creating a cycle in an acyclic graph exits the process with a [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mcyclic[0m message.
