[;1mÂ Â name_all()[0m

  A file name used as input into [;;4mfile[0m API functions.

  If VM is in Unicode filename mode, characters are allowed to be >
  255. [;;4mRawFilename[0m is a filename not subject to Unicode
  translation, meaning that it can contain characters not conforming
  to the Unicode encoding expected from the file system (that is,
  non-UTF-8 characters although the VM is started in Unicode
  filename mode). Null characters (integer value zero) are not
  allowed in filenames (not even at the end).
