[;1mÂ Â family_intersection(Family1, Family2)[0m

  If [;;4mFamily1[0m and [;;4mFamily2[0m are families, then [;;4mFamily3[0m is the
  family such that the index set is the intersection of [;;4mFamily1[0m:s
  and [;;4mFamily2[0m:s index sets, and [;;4mFamily3[0m[i] is the intersection
  of [;;4mFamily1[0m[i] and [;;4mFamily2[0m[i].
