[;1mÂ Â hibernate()[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP @OTP-19503@

  Puts the calling process into a wait state where its memory
  allocation has been reduced as much as possible. This is useful if
  the process does not expect to receive any messages soon.

  The process is awakened when a message is sent to it, and control
  resumes normally to the caller. Unlike [;;4merlang:hibernate/3[0m, it
  does not discard the call stack.
