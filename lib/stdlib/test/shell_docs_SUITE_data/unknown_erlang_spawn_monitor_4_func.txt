[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 23.0

  A new process is started by the application of [;;4mModule:Function[0m
  to [;;4mArgs[0m on the node [;;4mNode[0m. The process is monitored at the same
  time. Returns the process identifier and a reference for the
  monitor. Otherwise works like [;;4mspawn/3[0m.

  If the node identified by [;;4mNode[0m does not support distributed [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mspawn_monitor()[0m, the call will fail with a [;;4mnotsup[0m exception.
