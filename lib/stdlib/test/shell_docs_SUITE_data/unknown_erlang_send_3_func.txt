  message but returns something else (see below). Otherwise the same

  [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2,3[0m.

  Options:

   â€¢ [;;4mnosuspend[0m - If the sender would have to be suspended to do
     the send, [;;4mnosuspend[0m is returned instead.

   â€¢ [;;4mnoconnect[0m - If the destination node would have to be
     auto-connected to do the send, [;;4mnoconnect[0m is returned
     instead.
