[;1mÂ Â send(Dest, Msg, Options)[0m

  Either sends a message and returns [;;4mok[0m, or does not send the
  message but returns something else (see below). Otherwise the same
  as [;;4merlang:send/2[0m.

  For more detailed explanation and warnings, see [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2,3[0m.

  Options:

   â€¢ [;;4mnosuspend[0m - If the sender would have to be suspended to do
     the send, [;;4mnosuspend[0m is returned instead.

   â€¢ [;;4mnoconnect[0m - If the destination node would have to be
     auto-connected to do the send, [;;4mnoconnect[0m is returned
     instead.

   â€¢ [;;4mpriority[0m - Since OTP @OTP-19198@

     Send this message as a priority message. In order for the
     message to be handled as a priority message by the receiver,
     this option must be passed, and [;;4mDest[0m must be an active 
     priority alias.

     If [;;4mDest[0m is an active priority alias, but this option is
     not passed, the message will be handled as on ordinary
     message. The same is true, if this option is passed, but [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mDest[0m is not an active priority alias.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

       You very seldom need to resort to using priority
       messages and you may cause issues instead of solving
       issues if not used with care.

     For more information see, the Adding Messages to the
     Message Queue and the Enabling Priority Message Reception
     sections of the Erlang Reference Manual.

  [;;4mNote[0m

    For some important information about distributed signals, see
    the Blocking Signaling Over Distribution section in the 
    Processes chapter of the Erlang Reference Manual.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    As with [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2,3[0m: use with extreme care.
