[;1mÂ Â append_element(Tuple1, Term)[0m

  Returns a new tuple that has one element more than [;;4mTuple1[0m, and
  contains the elements in [;;4mTuple1[0m followed by [;;4mTerm[0m as the last
  element.

  Semantically equivalent to [;;4mlist_to_tuple(tuple_to_list(Tuple1) ++[0m
  [;;4m[Term])[0m, but much faster.

  For example:

    > erlang:append_element({one, two}, three).
    {one,two,three}
