[;1mÂ Â link(PidOrPort, OptList)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP @OTP-19198@

  Provides an option list for modification of the link functionality
  provided by [;;4mlink/1[0m. The [;;4mPidOrPort[0m argument has the same
  meaning as when passed to [;;4mlink/1[0m.

  Currently available options:

   â€¢ [;;4mpriority[0m - Since OTP @OTP-19198@

     Enables priority message reception of [;;4mEXIT[0m messages due to
     the link for the calling process. If the link already exists
     without priority message reception enabled for the link,
     priority message reception will be enabled on the existing
     link. If the link already exists with priority message
     reception enabled and this option is not passed or [;;4mlink/1[0m
     is called, priority message reception for this link will be
     disabled.

     Note that priority message reception due to the link is 
     only enabled for the process that passed this option. If
     the linked process also wants to enable priority message
     reception, it needs to call [;;4mlink/2[0m passing the [;;4mpriority[0m
     option itself.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

       You very seldom need to resort to using priority
       messages and you may cause issues instead of solving
       issues if not used with care.

     For more information see the Adding Messages to the Message
     Queue section of the Erlang Reference Manual.
