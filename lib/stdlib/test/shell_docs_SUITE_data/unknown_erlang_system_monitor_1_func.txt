[;1mÂ Â system_monitor(Arg)[0m

  When called with argument [;;4mundefined[0m, all system performance
  monitoring settings are cleared.

  Calling the function with [;;4m{MonitorPid, Options}[0m as argument is
  the same as calling [;;4merlang:system_monitor(MonitorPid, Options)[0m.

  Returns the previous system monitor settings just like [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:system_monitor/0[0m.
