[;1mÂ Â exit(Dest, Reason, OptList)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP @OTP-19198@

  Provides an option list for modification of the functionality
  provided by the [;;4mexit/2[0m BIF. The [;;4mDest[0m and [;;4mReason[0m arguments
  has the same meaning as when passed to the [;;4mexit/2[0m BIF.

  Currently available options:

   â€¢ [;;4mpriority[0m -- Since OTP @OTP-19198@

     Send this exit signal as a priority exit signal. In order
     for the signal to be handled as a priority [;;4mEXIT[0m message by
     the receiver, this option must be passed, [;;4mDest[0m must be
     an active priority alias and the receiver must be
     trapping exits.

     If [;;4mDest[0m is an active priority alias, but this option is
     not passed, the exit signal will be handled as on ordinary
     exit signal. The same is true, if this option is passed, but [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mDest[0m is not an active priority alias.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

       You very seldom need to resort to using priority
       messages and you may cause issues instead of solving
       issues if not used with care.

     For more information see, the Adding Messages to the
     Message Queue and the Enabling Priority Message Reception
     sections of the Erlang Reference Manual.
