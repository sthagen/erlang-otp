[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 27.0

  Returns [;;4m{ok, Binary}[0m, where [;;4mBinary[0m is a binary data object
  that contains the contents of [;;4mFilename[0m, or [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m if
  an error occurs.

  If the option [;;4mraw[0m is set, the file server is not called.

  Typical error reasons:

   â€¢ [;;4menoent[0m - The file does not exist.

   â€¢ [;;4meacces[0m - Missing permission for reading the file, or for
     searching one of the parent directories.

   â€¢ [;;4meisdir[0m - The named file is a directory.

   â€¢ [;;4menotdir[0m - A component of the filename is not a directory.
     On some platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.

   â€¢ [;;4menomem[0m - There is not enough memory for the contents of the
     file.
