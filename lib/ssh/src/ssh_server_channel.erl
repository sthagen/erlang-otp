SSH services (clients and servers) are implemented as channels that are
multiplexed over an SSH connection and communicates over the
[SSH Connection Protocol](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4254.txt). This module
provides a callback API that takes care of generic channel aspects for daemons,
such as flow control and close messages. It lets the callback functions take
care of the service (application) specific parts. This behavior also ensures
that the channel process honors the principal of an OTP-process so that it can
be part of a supervisor tree. This is a requirement of channel processes
implementing a subsystem that will be added to the `ssh` applications supervisor
tree.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> When implementing a client subsystem handler, use
> [\-behaviour(ssh_client_channel)](`m:ssh_client_channel`) instead.

Makes necessary initializations and returns the initial channel state if the
initializations succeed.

The time-out values that can be returned have the same semantics as in a

[`handle_msg(timeout, State)`](`c:handle_msg/2`).

This function is called by a channel process when it is about to terminate.

  This is the first message that the channel receives. This is especially useful
  if the server wants to send a message to the client without first receiving a
  message from it. If the message is not useful for your particular scenario,
  ignore it by immediately returning `{ok, State}`.

  message to the other side, if such a message has not already been sent. Then
