# ./create-dropbear-ssh

# This way of fetching the tar-file separate from the docker commands makes
# http-proxy handling way easier. The wget command handles the $https_proxy
# variable while the docker command must have /etc/docker/something changed
# and the docker server restarted. That is not possible without root access.

# Make a Dockerfile. This method simplifies env variable handling considerably:
cat - > TempDockerFile <<EOF

    FROM ubuntubuildbase

    WORKDIR /buildroot

    RUN apt-get -y update
    RUN apt-get -y upgrade
    RUN apt-get -y install openssh-sftp-server
%%    RUN echo 81 | apt-get -y install dropbear

EOF

# Build the image:
docker build -t ssh_compat_suite-ssh-dropbear -f ./TempDockerFile .

# Cleaning
rm -fr ./TempDockerFile $TMP
