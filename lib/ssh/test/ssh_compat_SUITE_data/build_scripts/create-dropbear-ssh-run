# This way of fetching the tar-file separate from the docker commands makes
# http-proxy handling way easier. The wget command handles the $https_proxy
# variable while the docker command must have /etc/docker/something changed
# and the docker server restarted. That is not possible without root access.

# Make a Dockerfile. This method simplifies env variable handling considerably:
cat - > TempDockerFile <<EOF

    FROM ssh_compat_suite-ssh-dropbear-installed:${VER}

    WORKDIR /buildroot

    CMD dropbear -F -p 1234

EOF

# Build the image:
docker build -t ssh_compat_suite-ssh:dropbear${VER} -f ./TempDockerFile .

# Cleaning
rm -fr ./TempDockerFile $TMP
