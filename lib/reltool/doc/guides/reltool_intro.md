# Introduction

Reltool is a release management tool. It analyses a given Erlang/OTP
installation and determines various dependencies between applications. The
`graphical` frontend depicts the dependencies and enables interactive
customization of a target system. The backend provides a `batch` interface for
generation of customized target systems.
