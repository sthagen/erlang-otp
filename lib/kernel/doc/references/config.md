# config

Configuration file.

## Description

A _configuration file_ contains values for configuration parameters for the
applications in the system. The `erl` command-line argument
[`-config Name`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#config`) tells the system to use data in the
system configuration file `Name.config`.

The erl command-line argument [`-configfd`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#configfd`) works
the same way as the `-config` option but specifies a file descriptor to read
configuration data from instead of a file.

The configuration data from configuration files and file descriptors are read in
the same order as they are given on the command line. For example,
`erl -config a -configfd 3 -config b -configfd 4` would cause the system to read
configuration data in the following order `a.config`, file descriptor `3`,
`b.config`, and file descriptor `4`. If a configuration parameter is specified
more than once in the given files and file descriptors, the last one overrides
the previous ones.

Configuration parameter values in a configuration file or file descriptor
override the values in the application resource files (see [`app(4)`](app.md)).
The values in the configuration file are always overridden by command-line flags
(see [`erts:erl(1)`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md`)).

The value of a configuration parameter is retrieved by calling
`application:get_env/1,2`.

## File Syntax

The configuration file is to be called `Name.config`, where `Name` is any name.

File `.config` contains a single Erlang term and has the following syntax:

```erlang
[{Application1, [{Par11, Val11}, ...]},
 ...
 {ApplicationN, [{ParN1, ValN1}, ...]}].
```

- **`Application = atom()`** - Application name.

- **`Par = atom()`** - Name of a configuration parameter.

- **`Val = term()`** - Value of a configuration parameter.

## sys.config

When starting Erlang in embedded mode, it is assumed that exactly one system
configuration file is used, named `sys.config`. This file is to be located in
`$ROOT/releases/Vsn`, where `$ROOT` is the Erlang/OTP root installation
directory and `Vsn` is the release version.

Release handling relies on this assumption. When installing a new release
version, the new `sys.config` is read and used to update the application's
configurations.

This means that specifying another `.config` file, or more `.config` files,
leads to an inconsistent update of application configurations. There is,
however, a way to point out other config files from a `sys.config`. How to do
this is described in the next section.

## Including Files from sys.config and -configfd Configurations

There is a way to include other configuration files from a `sys.config` file and
from a configuration that comes from a file descriptor that has been pointed out
with the [`-configfd`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#configfd`) command-line argument.

The syntax for including files can be described by the
[Erlang type language](`e:system:typespec.md`) like this:

```text
[{Application, [{Par, Val}]} | IncludeFile].
```

- **`IncludeFile = string()`** - Name of a `.config` file. The extension
  `.config` can be omitted. It is recommended to use absolute paths. If a
  relative path is used in a `sys.config`, `IncludeFile` is searched, first,
  relative to the `sys.config` directory, then relative to the current working
  directory of the emulator. If a relative path is used in a `-configfd`
  configuration, `IncludeFile` is searched, first, relative to the dictionary
  containing the [boot script](`e:sasl:script.md`) (see also the
  [`-boot`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#boot`) command-line argument) for the emulator,
  then relative to the current working directory of the emulator. This makes it
  possible to use `sys.config` for pointing out other `.config` files in a
  release or in a node started manually using `-config` or `-configfd` with the
  same result whatever the current working directory is.

When traversing the contents of a `sys.config` or a `-configfd` configuration
and a filename is encountered, its contents are read and merged with the result
so far. When an application configuration tuple `{Application, Env}` is found,
it is merged with the result so far. Merging means that new parameters are added
and existing parameter values are overwritten.

_Example:_

```text
sys.config:

["/home/user/myconfig1"
 {myapp,[{par1,val1},{par2,val2}]},
 "/home/user/myconfig2"].

myconfig1.config:

[{myapp,[{par0,val0},{par1,val0},{par2,val0}]}].

myconfig2.config:

[{myapp,[{par2,val3},{par3,val4}]}].
```

This yields the following environment for `myapp`:

```text
[{par0,val0},{par1,val1},{par2,val3},{par3,val4}]
```

The run-time system will abort before staring up if an include file specified in
`sys.config` or a `-configfd` configuration does not exist, or is erroneous.
However, installing a new release version will not fail if there is an error
while loading an include file, but an error message is returned and the
erroneous file is ignored.
