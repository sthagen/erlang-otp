## Scope

The Kernel application has all the code necessary to run the Erlang runtime
system: file servers, code servers, and so on.

sense that the minimal system based on Erlang/OTP consists of Kernel and STDLIB.
Kernel contains the following functional areas:

- Start, stop, supervision, configuration, and distribution of applications
- Code loading
- Logging
- Global name service
- Supervision of Erlang/OTP
- Communication with sockets
- Operating system interface

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang programming language.
