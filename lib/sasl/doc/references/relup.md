Release upgrade file

## Description

The _release upgrade file_ describes how a release is upgraded in a running
system.

This file is automatically generated by
[`systools:make_relup/3,4`](`systools:make_relup/3`), using a release resource
file (`.rel`), application resource files (`.app`), and application upgrade
files (`.appup`) as input.

## File Syntax

In a target system, the release upgrade file is to be located in directory
`$ROOT/releases/Vsn`.

The `relup` file contains one single Erlang term, which defines the instructions
used to upgrade the release. The file has the following syntax:

```c
{Vsn,
  [{UpFromVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...],
  [{DownToVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...]}.
```

- **`Vsn = string()`** - Current release version.

- **`UpFromVsn = string()`** - Earlier version of the release to upgrade from.

- **`Descr = term()`** - A user-defined parameter passed from the function
  [`systools:make_relup/3,4`](`systools:make_relup/3`). It is used in the return
  value of
  [`release_handler:install_release/1,2`](`release_handler:install_release/1`).

- **`Instructions`** - A list of low-level release upgrade instructions, see
  [`appup(4)`](appup.md). It consists of the release upgrade instructions from
  the respective application upgrade files (high-level instructions are
  translated to low-level instructions), in the same order as in the start
  script.

- **`DownToVsn = string()`** - Earlier version of the release to downgrade to.
