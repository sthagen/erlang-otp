Release resource file

## Description

The _release resource file_ specifies which applications are included in a
release (system) based on Erlang/OTP.

This file is used by the functions in `m:systools` when generating start scripts
(`.script`, `.boot`) and release upgrade files (`relup`).

## File Syntax

The release resource file is to be called `Name.rel`.

The `.rel` file contains one single Erlang term, which is called a _release
specification_. The file has the following syntax:

```erlang
{release, {RelName,Vsn}, {erts, EVsn},
  [{Application, AppVsn} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type} |
   {Application, AppVsn, IncApps} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type, IncApps}]}.
```

- **`RelName = string()`** - Release name.

- **`Vsn = string()`** - Release version.

- **`EVsn = string()`** - ERTS version the release is intended for.

- **`Application = atom()`** - Name of an application included in the release.

- **`AppVsn = string()`** - Version of an application included in the release.

- **`Type = permanent | transient | temporary | load | none`** - Start type of
  an application included in the release.

  If `Type = permanent | transient | temporary`, the application is loaded and
  started in the corresponding way, see `m:application`.

  If `Type = load`, the application is only loaded.

  If `Type = none`, the application is not loaded and not started, although the
  code for its modules is loaded.

  Defaults to `permanent`

- **`IncApps = [atom()]`** - A list of applications that are included by an
  application included in the release. The list must be a subset of the included
  applications specified in the application resource file (`Application.app`)
  and overrides this value. Defaults to the same value as in the application
  resource file.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> The list of applications must contain the Kernel and STDLIB applications.
