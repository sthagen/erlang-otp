# Introduction

## Scope

The SASL application provides support for:

- Error logging
- Alarm handling
- Release handling
- Report browsing

Section [SASL Error Logging](error_logging.md) describes the error handler that
produces the supervisor, progress, and crash reports, which can be written to
screen or to a specified file. It also describes the Report Browser (RB).

The sections about release structure and release handling have been moved to
section [OTP Design Principles](`e:system:index.html`) in _System
Documentation_.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang programming language.
